With tariffs set to kick in tonight, Razer’s new Blade 16 and other laptops are no longer available to purchase directly. by  Antonio G. Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Razer’s upcoming Blade 16 and other laptops are no longer available for preorder or purchase on its US site. The configurator for preordering its new Blade 16 laptop was available as recently as April 1st, according to the Internet Archive — one day before the Trump administration announced sweeping US tariffs on China, Taiwan, and others that make laptop components. When asked recently if tariffs might affect Razer’s prices or availability, its Public Relations Manager, Andy Johnston, told The Verge, “We do not have a comment at this stage regarding tariffs.” Razer may not be openly talking about the impact of tariffs, but Framework halted sales of its entry-level Laptop 13 in the US on April 7th, and Micron reportedly confirmed surcharges for its memory chips will apply once the tariffs take effect after midnight tonight. The direct link to the Blade 16 configurator now takes you to a 404 error page, and its product page only has a “notify me” button instead of anywhere to submit your preorder. While shopping for other laptops on Razer’s site, only skins and accessories are available for purchase. Even a new laptop stand Razer announced today, which a press release said would be “available now,” only has a “notify me” button with no price listed anywhere. Meanwhile, the same laptop stand has a price of $99.99 CA on the Razer Canada site, where the Blade 16 configurator is still available. It’s a similar story for Razer’s site in other countries as well. We’ve contacted Razer for further comment on tariffs and asked for confirmation that it has paused sales, but it did not respond by the time of publication.

    "full_content": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Thursday that the US intends to take chip manufacturing from Taiwan. Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that while President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs didn't apply to semiconductors, Trump is still looking at how the US can regain its foothold in chip making. \"Donald Trump's going to deeply study those. And those are going to come later on how to reshore from Taiwan all that semiconductor manufacturing,\" Lutnick said. \"We have to protect ourselves at some point. America has to be able to protect itself.\" Lutnick also questioned why the US's electronics are \"primarily built in Taiwan.\" \"It used to be built here. Our policies let Taiwan take it all,\" Lutnick said. \"We all hold our iPhones, which we love. Why do they have to be made in Taiwan and China? Why can't those be made with robotics in America? And you know what Donald Trump has said? They're going to be made in America,\" he added. On Wednesday, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on all countries with tariffs on US goods. Trump said the tariffs will start at a baseline rate of 10% and affect 185 countries. Taiwan was hit with a reciprocal tariff of 32%. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" Trump said in his announcement. While on the campaign trail, Trump said Taiwan had grown wealthy by taking away the US's chip manufacturing business. Taiwan produces 92% of the world's most advanced microchips, per the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association. \"I mean, how stupid are we? They took all of our chip business. They're immensely wealthy.\" Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview published in July. \"They took almost 100% of our chip industry, I give them credit. That's because stupid people were running the country. We should have never let that happen,\" Trump added. On Thursday, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te wrote in a Facebook post that Trump's reciprocal tariffs were \"unreasonable\" and did not reflect the \"highly complementary and substantive trading relationship between Taiwan and the US.\" Lai said his government will continue to negotiate with the Trump administration. The US has long been trying to reduce its dependence on Taiwan for chip manufacturing. In 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law. The bipartisan bill was meant to bolster US chipmaking by channeling billions of dollars in federal funding to the chip industry. In November, the Biden administration said it had awarded up to $6.6 billion in funding to TSMC to build three chip factories in Phoenix, Arizona. However, experts told Business Insider that while such initiatives would help to bolster chip making in the US, TSMC will probably continue to make its most advanced chips in Taiwan. \"It's very unlikely that the Taiwanese government would allow TSMC to build its most advanced fabs in the US without a few years' lag,\" said Chris Miller, the author of \"Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology.\" \"This is Taiwan's most valuable strategic capability. Without it, extracting a US security guarantee or support from the Trump administration goes from hard to impossible,\" Miller added. Representatives for Lutnick at the Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment from BI.",

    "full_content": "In a world already shaken by economic shocks — from the pandemic to sweeping tariffs — there's one scenario that would dwarf them all: a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. This is the hypothetical the analyst Ben Thompson floats in the latest edition of Stratechery, a newsletter widely followed by tech industry insiders. An invasion wouldn't just be a military conflict; it would be a rupture in the global economic order that underpins everything from iPhones to inflation forecasts. Thompson reckons China would prevail militarily. The larger story isn't about who controls Taipei — it's about what happens when the world's most essential supply chains are shattered. Taiwan isn't just any island. It's home to TSMC, the company responsible for manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors in the world. Take that away, and the modern tech ecosystem buckles — taking with it the digital infrastructure of daily life. This is so important that there's even a theory quietly discussed among global security experts that Taiwan could threaten to destroy its giant chip fabrication facilities to deter China from invading. Thompson argues that regardless of who wins militarily, the economic result is the same: China, the global factory, is effectively cut off. Taiwan's chip output vanishes. Global trade grinds lower. Inflation surges. Markets tank. Recall the 2020 COVID-19 supply chain chaos or last week's market turmoil from Trump's tariff barrage — now magnify that impact exponentially. \"A war over Taiwan,\" Thompson wrote on Monday, \"would put all of these to shame.\" Of course, it's not clear whether, or when, China would invade Taiwan. And even if it did invade, it would face challenges, the defense writer Michael Peck says. But what's particularly striking is Thompson's framing: War might not just break the system — but also be the only way to reset it. The post-World War II economic order, rebooted by Bretton Woods and supercharged by China's entry into global markets, is showing its age. The US traded industrial capability for cheap goods and ballooning deficits. American manufacturing jobs vanished, supply chains lengthened, and the economic resilience of the US heartland hollowed out. (These are the areas where Vice President JD Vance's anti-globalization message really resonates, by the way.) Trump's tariffs — clumsy, politically divisive, and economically painful — might still be preferable to waiting for a war to force change. As Thompson notes, the system can't be fixed without a stomach for hard trade-offs, and America seems unwilling to take the hit until it's forced to. So we return to the Taiwan question — if China invades, or how close we come. The prudent path, Thompson suggests, may be to pull China deeper into economic interdependence, betting that shared prosperity can delay or prevent disaster. But if that gamble fails, the cost won't just be measured in GDP — it'll be in decades of lost stability, broken industries, and a new global order forged not in peace but in fire.",

    "full_content": "The head of the British armed forces has visited China for the first time in a decade. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin discussed \"issues of common concern\" with China's military leaders in Beijing, its defence ministry said in a short statement. \"We agreed that in an unstable world we must play our part as responsible nations with global interests,\" Sir Tony wrote on X, \"and we reflected on the importance of military-to-military communications\". The last time a Chief of the Defence Staff visited China was in 2015. Since becoming prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer has sought to strengthen ties with the country. The admiral's visit coincided with the escalation of an intense trade war between China and the US after President Trump's announcement of higher tariffs. Defence Secretary John Healey confirmed on Thursday that the trip had happened earlier this week. \"It's always good to have military to military engagement and that is what he was establishing\", Healey told reporters in Brussels. He said that the admiral's visit followed in the footsteps of one made recently by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who became only the second foreign secretary to visit China in six years when he went in October last year. Healey said that in the discussions the admiral was \"very firm in the arguments about peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific\" region \"and concerns about any use of military aggression or assertiveness to pursue political ends\".  Healey did not specifically mention Taiwan, where China has launched major military drills which have been seen as provocation towards the island and wider region. Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. Sir Tony has now joined the defence secretary in Brussels for meetings with allies on Ukraine.",

    "full_content": "FORT BRAGG, North Carolina — The low hum of a quadcopter drone cuts through the air like a buzzing bee. It's faint and difficult to track. The sound grows louder as the swarm builds. The drones are fast and small and hard to see, but the noise of the growing swarm is becoming overwhelming. They are rushing over barren dirt roads and empty buildings. Then the bombs begin to fall, and the explosions are deafening. People are hit, collapsing on the ground, screaming, covered in blood as dust fills the air. It's chaos. This shocking opening act was just one element of a training exercise at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where US Army Special Operations Command held its annual Capabilities Exercise, or CAPEX, last week. Open to the public, CAPEX offers a close look at what US Army Special Operations Forces are working on and how they'd respond to a potential real-world conflict. This year's scenario was a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a growing concern as China modernizes its forces. The day began with a briefing from Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, the USASOC commanding general, on the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Braga highlighted 2027, the date Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has indicated China's military needs to be ready to invade Taiwan. While there's no guarantee it takes that step, Braga called it \"by exponential means, the greatest threat we have.\" Thinking about that challenge is playing a role in shaping how ARSOF operators train and the capabilities they develop. American special operators are in a transition period. After decades of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations, they are now shifting, along with the rest of the military, toward great-power competition and potential conflict with a top adversary. Special forces leaders have said the change requires new skillsets from operators that will affect how they approach supporting conventional forces and irregular warfare. In some respects, it will mean a return to Cold War-era roles and tactics. Throughout the CAPEX, ARSOF personnel talked at length about what they're prioritizing. Drones and other uncrewed systems are at the forefront. The initial, simulated drone attack from Chinese forces during the exercise left a few people \"wounded,\" prompting ARSOF to demonstrate their crisis and medical responses. It was tense but orderly — personnel cared for superficial wounds, assessed serious injuries, and took immediate action. The drill shifted into high gear when ARSOF went on offense with a raid into enemy territory aimed at opening up a temporary air corridor for follow-on forces. From the top of a building, BI and others watched as an assault team broke from cover, surprising its enemies with rapid M240B machine gun fire. It was loud and sudden. The American team then took control of the area surrounding a Russian-made SCUD tactical ballistic missile. Enemy uncrewed aerial systems flew around the area, leading to the use of counter-drone capabilities to detect, track, and ultimately neutralize them. Officials said the counter-UAS system used sensors and deployed interceptor drones to conduct a \"command-link takeover\" that essentially breaks the connection between drones and their operators. That system was then used to identify the launch point of the drones. With a loitering munition and a separate drone, the assault team took out the targets. With the air corridor open, forces from the 75th Ranger Regiment and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment were then able to enter the area and target a key enemy facility: a hostile command and control center. Two MH-47 Chinook helicopters, special operations variants of the heavy lift transport aircraft, soared in from the distant tree line. The arrival of the Chinooks was fast. As they came in, they stirred up dirt and dust, making it hard to see two assault squads scurried down ropes, called a fast-rope insertion, from the helicopters onto the tops of adjacent buildings. Just as quickly as they arrived, the helicopters flew off. They couldn't linger. The assault groups cleared the buildings before lining up for an explosive breach of the enemy command building. First-person-view drones were flying around, too, providing critical situational awareness. Once the center's entrance was breached, the groups filed in, neutralizing enemy combatants in close-quarters combat. The combat exercise also included an enemy counterattack. ARSOF fought with Carl Gustaf Recoilless Rifles that fire 84 mm rockets, M240B (7.62) machine guns, M320 grenade launchers, 60mm mortar systems, and Javelin. The counterattack was quickly defeated. And to top it off, ARSOF fired a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to target enemy air defenses and continue to keep the air corridor open, making further infiltration and exfiltration an option. The CAPEX offered visitors a whirlwind look at aspects of a possible fight during a potential Chinese invasion, but it also highlighted other aspects of ARSOF. Its Civil Affairs component, as well as language courses and physical and mental health requirements, were also demonstrated. Col. Luke VanAntwerp, director of US Army Special Operations Command's Capability Development Integration Directorate, called ARSOF \"an incredible bargain\" for the US military. \"With a small investment, a small number of people with generational relationships,\" he said, operators can deter conflict. If it breaks out, though, they want to make sure they can exact a toll on the adversary wherever and however is most effective. USASOC is made up of around 33,000 people. That's less than 6% of the Army, but it's more than 51% of the US military's special operations forces. They're deployed to more than 70 countries, learn 17 different languages, and focus on deterring conflict, making relationships with partners and allies, and keeping their finger on the pulse of what's happening.",

    "full_content": "Google seems to be looking in a different direction for its next set of AI chips. According to a report by The Information, the tech giant could be collaborating with Taiwan's chip maker MediaTek. These chips also known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), would be produced sometime next year, sources close to the project told the publication. It is important to note that Google makes its chips that help train its AI models. However, it relies on Broadcom, an American chip company, to design its TPUs with the help of blueprints provided by Google. This has been the case ever since Google produced its first-gen TPU back in 2015. However, now, after almost a decade of working together, it has decided to broaden its reach. This collab with MediaTek doesn't indicate Google breaking ties with Broadcom but is being frugal about how much it spends on designing its TPUs. As of today, Google TPUs are custom-designed chips used for training large AI models like Gemini and are ideal for training chatbots, code generation, media content generation, and personalization models, among others. It also produces another kind of TPU that deals with \"interference needs\" and powers its existing services like Search and YouTube, The Information added.  The reason it could be making the switch to MediaTek could be because it charges less per chip compared to Broadcom and has a strong relationship with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited), The Information stated. An internal source told the publication that it might be doing things differently with MediaTek; it will handle most of the design of its next TPU, including the processor. \"MediaTek will aim to handle what are known as input/output modules, which manage the communication between the main processors and peripheral components, said one of the two people involved in the project.\" But much like Broadcom, it will handle the chip production process, \"which includes packaging and quality testing,\" another source from Google's TPU team told the Information. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Last year, Google seems to have spent between $6 billion and $9 billion to create one of the most powerful 6th-generation TPUs, according to Reuters. But if it does take the MediaTek route, it could be spending much less and will also give Google an upper hand over other AI companies like ChatGPT and Microsoft, which both rely on American-based chipmakers.

    "full_content": "It's not just a show of force. China's military activities around Taiwan are increasingly realistic combat training, readying it for the real deal. New research on these activities indicates the Chinese military is more active near Taiwan than it has been in the past, with increased daily operations and more frequent patrols and exercises. K. Tristan Tang, a research associate at the Research Project on China's Defense Affairs, writes in a new report that China's military activities in the waters and airspace around Taiwan reached a new high last year. This trend continued in January and February of this year, with activity surging higher. The Chinese activity around Taiwan consistently prompts responses from Tawain's military, such as air defense and shore battery movements, combat air patrols, and more, and those responses offer valuable insight to the Chinese armed forces. In this situation, China's People's Liberation Army is \"using the enemy to train the troops,\" a practice of conducting exercises close to foreign forces for more realistic and applicable outcomes, Tang said. Similar observations have been made about the risky maneuvers around US aircraft by Chinese pilots. The Chinese navy, likewise, has embraced this doctrine with US vessels. Realistic combat training has been a growing priority for the Chinese PLA and has been heavily emphasized in recent years. It allows troops to get a better sense of the actual challenges on the battlefield and understand more about their adversaries. These aren't simple displays of military power, there for show; instead, the activities offer experience needed for combat action. Chinese leader Xi Jinping emphasized the need for realistic combat training in 2018, instructing the military to \"to strengthen real combat training and improve its war-winning capability,\" according to state media. The emphasis could be seen in PLA's recent large-scale joint exercises surrounding Taiwan, namely the two \"Joint Sword\" drills that occurred last year. Joint Sword-2024 A occurred in May, while Joint Sword-2024 B took place in October. Both involved elements of the PLA conducting demonstrations around Taiwan. May's came on the heels of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's inauguration and October's after Taiwanese Independence Day. The drills sent a message to Taiwan and its international partners, but there was more to it than that. Two developments seen in 2025 so far indicate the PLA Navy specifically is enhancing its realistic combat training, per Tang. The first is that PLA Navy activities around Taiwan have seen an overall increase. Numbers from Taiwan's Ministry of Defense indicate a rise in the number of PLAN vessels operating near Taiwan compared to previous years, 419 in the first two months of this year compared to 305 in 2024 and 218 in 2023. Similarly, the number of joint combat readiness patrols involving assets from multiple military branches, such as PLAN vessels and PLA Air Force planes, are higher as well. And the number of PLAN ships involved in these patrols is up, too. Another notable development was the large deployment of a Type 75 landing helicopter dock amphibious assault ship task force near Taiwan last month, which was early in the annual training cycle and the largest publicly disclosed LHD task force ever near Taiwan, Tang said. It's not initially clear whether these efforts are intended to put pressure on Taiwan or if increasing readiness ahead of China's 2027 goals is the priority. US officials have said China plans to be ready to take Taiwan — by force, if necessary — by that year. That is an observed readiness goal, not necessarily an assault date. China considers Taiwan as part of its territory. Xi has made reunification with the island nation a priority. China has broad military modernization goals for 2027, the 100th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army. It also has goals for 2035 and 2049, the latter of which is 100 years after the founding of the People's Republic of China. By then, China intends to possess a \"world-class military\" that can fight and win wars. Increasing its military presence around Taiwan to gain more realistic training falls in line with \"accelerating efforts to meet\" the 2027 agenda items, Tang said, \"regardless of whether an actual invasion of Taiwan occurs.\" Documents related to Taiwan's defense drills that were reviewed by Bloomberg identified 2027 as a possible invasion date. The Han Kuang Exercise, Taiwan's largest live-fire defense drill, will also double in length to 10 days in total this summer. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm these details. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US didn't immediately respond to BI's questions on the date or its impact on the annual exercise.",

    "full_content": "Seeking adventure and needing to pay off student loans, I moved to Taiwan in my early 20s. I was complaining about my debt when a friend mentioned that teaching English abroad could be a good way out. My job as a child and youth worker in Canada was not covering the bills. I convinced my then-boyfriend to join and we spent the next two and half years teaching kindergarten and elementary students in Taiwan But after fiscal success, having achieved our goal, we decided to move back to Canada. Returning home in my mid-20s with an inflated ego after a few years of easy money, a comfortable life, and a level of respect as an English teacher proved to be a hindrance to my success in Canada. We lost a lot of our savings in the time it took us to set up our lives again. We struggled to find jobs in Canada that paid enough to meet living expenses and ended up moving four times between cities. We found ourselves once again in a financial hole that was becoming deeper with every passing year. So, 6 years later, after getting married, we returned to Taiwan in 2009, this time, our plan was to relocate permanently. I spent most of my 30s, the next 7 and a half years, in Taiwan teaching English. I loved the job, the lifestyle, having financial security, the opportunity to travel, designing my dream apartment, and eventually, adopting three cats. However, even though we were building a good life in Taiwan, it didn't negate the fact that a significant part of our life was back in Canada, our family. While living in Taiwan, my father-in-law died suddenly of a heart attack, and our world tilted. We went home to mourn with my husband's family but realized two weeks was an insignificant amount of time to process such a loss. Just over a year later my nephew passed away on his school playground at recess. He was 8 years old and I had spent 7 years in Taiwan. I had met him only a few times in his short life. Suddenly, the money, the pretty apartment, and the beautiful view no longer held us captive.  My husband and I starkly began to understand that the distance between us and our family meant that we could not really be a part of each other's lives. We could not be there to grieve, celebrate, or share. We've now been back in Ontario, Canada for almost 8 years. I'm involved in my nieces and nephews' lives and I take time to travel with my sisters. My five brothers are no longer strangers to me. I've been able to visit my only living grandparent many times since I've been back — she's in her mid-90s. I see family almost every month now for holidays or sometimes just to get together. At 46, after starting over in Canada again, changing careers, and dealing with the rising cost of living, I doubt that we'll ever be financially comfortable again. We'll probably never own a house, buy a new car, go on fancy vacations, or have a comfortable retirement. But it's all worth it to watch my nieces and nephews grow into adults. I also have time for intimate conversations with my siblings during car rides or while hiking nearby. I found grand adventures out there — lessons and insights that came when I stripped away everything familiar and influential. Growth happened when I pushed beyond my boundaries and realized the only limits were the ones I had created.  I also came to see the tremendous value in sometimes staying put.",

    "full_content": "A quiet Japanese island has found itself on the front lines of the tense dispute over Taiwan. Growing tensions between China and Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims is part of its territory, has transformed Japan's once quaint ecotourism destination into a military fortress. Yonaguni, Japan's westernmost island, is located just shy of 100 miles from the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, making it a strategic frontline outpost for Japan and allies like the US. In a reminder of the island's new status, a cattle ranch has become a military base, and authorities are expanding the port to accommodate larger warships. \"As a child, I was so proud of this westernmost border island,\" Fumie Kano, an innkeeper on Yonaguni, told the Associated Press. \"But recently, we are repeatedly told this place is dangerous, and I feel so sad.\" While the influx of troops has boosted the island's security and economy, residents are forced to brace themselves against a possible conflict mere miles away. Located over 300 miles from Okinawa's main island, Yonaguni Island is considered the most remote of all the Okinawan islands. The island has an area of about 11 square miles — roughly the same size as Disney World's Magic Kingdom theme park. Only a third of the island is inhabited by three villages — Sonai, Kubura, and Higawa — with the remaining area being covered by farmland and vegetation. Fishing, agriculture, and tourism are the main sources of livelihood for the island's tiny population of about 1,500 people. The island was once home to 12,000 people in the late 1940s, but has shrunk to less than 2,000 people in recent years. Yonaguni is known for its picturesque landscapes and rare animal species, including three-foot-tall ponies that can only be found on the island. The Atlas moth, considered the world's largest moth with a wingspan of nearly 10 inches, is also native to the island. As Japan's westernmost inhabited island, it is the last place in Japan to see the setting sun. In 2021, the island also inspired Bad Bunny's chart-topping reggaeton song, Yonaguni, in which the Puerto Rican rapper sings in both Spanish and Japanese. The island is also known for mysterious underwater ruins stretching over 300 feet near its southern coast, known as the Yonaguni Monument. Whether the monument was manmade or naturally formed is still under debate, with scientists estimating that the megalith could have been created long before humans had the means to create such a structure. Divers have spotted hammerhead sharks and, on rare occasions, a whale shark, the largest fish in the world. Yonaguni lies less than 70 miles from the east coast of Taiwan between the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea. As China's military presence continues to grow in the region, Japan has strengthened its military presence, particularly on its southwestern islands, such as Ishigaki, Miyako, and Yonaguni. A cattle ranch on Yonaguni has been transformed into a military base, and Japanese forces plan to expand an airport and port on the island's south coast to accommodate large ships. The Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force has deployed US-made PAC-3 interceptor missile units and Japanese surface-to-air missile systems to the southwestern islands. Tom Shugart, former US Navy submariner and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the missile systems could be useful in a conflict scenario over Taiwan. \"If Japan is involved in helping to defend Taiwan, which it has said it might, then that system might be useful,\" Shugart told Newsweek. \"Not so much for protecting any large-scale infrastructure on Yonaguni — because I don't think there is any — but it might be useful for protecting offensive systems that could be used against China.\" Despite residents voting to bring Japanese military forces and assets to the island, some locals remain apprehensive about the rapid militarization of the island. \"Even those who voted in favour of the base are scared about missiles being based here,\" Toshio Sakimoto, a local councillor, told The Guardian. \"I worry whenever something is happening in Taiwan, such as an election or Chinese military drills.\" To quell islanders' fears about what would happen in an actual emergency, officials released a plan last detailing the evacuation of 120,000 residents on remote islands in just under a week. Yonaguni Mayor Kenichi Itokazu proposed building a basement shelter and expanding its port to support evacuation efforts by sea, though skepticism still surrounds the contingency efforts. \"It's absurd,\" Kano, the Yonaguni innkeeper, told AP of the evacuation plan. \"I just hope the money will be spent on policies that will help the people in Yonaguni live peacefully.\" Not only has the landscape of Yonaguni changed in recent years, but the population is also experiencing a shift. Following a 2015 referendum, hundreds of Japanese troops have been deployed to Yonaguni, including a coast watch unit and an electronic warfare unit. The local economy has improved and, in turn, grown largely dependent on Japanese military personnel and their families which now make up a fifth of the island's population, sparking concerns for local civilians. \"Everything is pushed through in the name of the Taiwan emergency,\" Kyoko Yamaguchi, a local potter, told the AP, \"and many feel this is too much.\" Public data forecasts that the troop population and their dependents could make up over 31% of the island's tiny 1,500-member population, The Guardian reported, with the potential to rise to almost 40% the following year. Tetsu Inomata, a café owner who lived in Yonaguni for 20 years, told The Guardian that he believes the Japanese armed forces could overtake the island's civilian population in the next few years. Residents of the island have seen firsthand China's increasing military presence in the region. In 2022, China fired several ballistic missiles into Japan's southwestern waters, one of which landed just 50 miles from Yonaguni island near 20 fishing boats, though no injuries or damage was reported in the incident. \"It was an extremely dangerous exercise that really made us feel China's potential threat right next to us,\" Shigenori Takenishi, chief of Yonaguni's fisheries association, told the AP. In August, the US Marine Corps deployed radar to Camp Yonaguni after Chinese Y-9 electronic intelligence aircraft and two drones presumed to belong to China passed near the island during surveillance missions of Taiwan. The next month, Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning transited through waters between Yonaguni and Iriomote Islands, which drew concern from the West. The percentage of Chinese warships passing through the Yonaguni Channel has increased since 2020 from 0 to over 26% as of 2024, according to Japan's defense ministry. The US and Japan have also conducted military drills in the region, in part to project power against China. Stressed by ongoing military activity, locals criticized the drills as disrupting the island's serenity. The militarization of the once-tranquil island has left residents divided on whether the buildup has been beneficial or detrimental. Supporters say Japanese military personnel have been crucial for the island's safety and a much-needed boost to its struggling local economy. Prior to hosting Japanese troops, Yonaguni officials had planned to form economic relations through commercial exchanges with Taiwan via direct ferries between the islands. Critics have accused the US and Japan of exploiting the island simply for the sake of military posturing against China, with little to no regard for its impact on its residents and the environment. \"I think the plan has been to have long-range missiles here that are capable of reaching the coast of China,\" Inomata, the café owner, told The Guardian. \"We're being used by the Americans, and Japanese leaders like Fumio Kishida and Shinzō Abe have been willing participants. For them, everything is about defense.\" Shoko Komine, a local restaurant owner, told The Guardian that there's a chance Yonaguni could get \"dragged into\" a conflict over Taiwan, which would drive people away from visiting the island. \"I don't think there is going to be a conflict any time soon, but even the risk of something happening will stop tourists from coming,\" Komine said. \"The town government should put more effort into promoting tourism, but at the moment it is obsessed with defense.\" Yonaguni residents fear the military build-up could tarnish the island's reputation as a peaceful island known for its untamed wildlife and beauty. \"Being at the center of this issue is very stressful for residents,\" local shopkeeper Takako Ueno told the AP. \"I don't want people to imagine this beautiful island turning into a battlefield.\"",

Along with the latest equipment — much of it from the United States, the military is seeking funds to retain more service people with higher pay and to lengthen compulsory national service from four months to one year. In a speech Thursday to the American Chamber of Commerce, Lai said his administration is determined to \"ensure that our defense budget exceeds 3% of the GDP. At the same time, we will continue to reform national defense.\" Lai's comments were the latest reassurance to U.S. and domestic critics who say Taiwan is not spending enough on its own defense. The self-governing island, which relies on the U.S. for much of its cutting-edge weaponry, currently spends about 2.45% of its gross domestic product on its military. U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that Taiwan increase defense spending as high as 10% of GDP, a proportion well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend, in order to deter China. China's actions have also unsettled neighbors in the South China Sea and other parts of the Indo-Pacific. Leaders in Australia and New Zealand have said China should have given them more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live fire exercises in the seas between the two countries last month, forcing flights to divert on short notice. Lai said that Taiwan plans to \"advance our cooperation with the U.S. and other democracies in upholding regional stability and prosperity.\" China considers the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its own territory and has significantly boosted its military to make good on its threat to invade the island to assert its control. Raymond Greene, the de-facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan; Dan Silver, the chamber chairperson; and Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy attended the speech. Taiwan and the U.S. have no formal diplomatic ties but American law requires Washington respond to threats toward the island.",

The new restrictions announced by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) are the latest attempt to block foreign access to cutting-edge American chips, despite prior objections from Nvidia and semiconductor industry groups. More than 50 of the new entities added to the list are based in China, with others located in Iran, Taiwan, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. BIS says the restrictions have been applied to entities that acted “contrary to US national security and foreign policy,” and are intended to hinder China’s ability to develop high-performance computing capabilities, quantum technologies, advanced artificial intelligence, and hypersonic weapons. “American technology should never be used against the American people,” said Jeffrey Kessler, Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security. “BIS is sending a clear, resounding message that the Trump administration will work tirelessly to safeguard our national security by preventing U.S. technologies and goods from being misused for high performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs that threaten our national security.” Six of the newly blacklisted entities are subsidiaries of Inspur Group — China’s leading cloud computing service provider and a major customer for US chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel — which BIS alleges had contributed to projects developing supercomputers for the Chinese military. The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence is another addition to the list, which has criticized its inclusion. “We are shocked that a private non-profit scientific research institution has been added to the entity list,” the research institute said in a statement to the Associated Press. “We strongly oppose this wrong decision without any factual basis and ask the relevant US departments to withdraw it.” China’s Foreign Ministry has also condemned the export controls, saying the blacklist expansion “seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations.” The updated export restrictions come amid already heated tensions between the US and China, with President Trump having imposed sweeping new tariffs against goods coming from the country since taking office.

The Register reports:  One of those companies is apparently called Yunhe Zhiwang (Shanghai) Technology Co., Ltd and develops high-end network chips. The Bureau claims its chips are used in China's \"Data East, Compute West\" strategy that, as we reported when it was announced in 2022, calls for five million racks full of kit to be moved from China's big cities in the east to new datacenters located near renewable energy sources in country's west. Datacenters in China's east will be used for latency-sensitive applications, while heavy lifting takes place in the west. Staff from Intel and Microsoft were apparently lured to work for Yunhe Zhiwang, which disguised its true ownership by working through a Singaporean company.\n \nThe Investigation Bureau also alleged that China's largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), used a Samoan company to establish a presence in Taiwan and then hired local talent. That's a concerning scenario as SMIC is on the USA's \"entity list\" of organizations felt to represent a national security risk. The US gets tetchy when its friends and allies work with companies on the entity list.\n \nA third Chinese entity, Shenzhen Tongrui Microelectronics Technology, disguised itself so well Taiwan's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology lauded it as an important innovator and growth company. As a result of the Bureau's work, prosecutors' offices in seven Taiwanese cities are now looking into 11 Chinese companies thought to have hidden their ties to Beijing.",

    "full_content": "The party started as so many do — with pancakes in a parking lot. I attended Nvidia's GTC conference, which has taken over downtown San Jose, California, this week. Tuesday was the biggest day for the AI juggernaut. At 10 a.m. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began his keynote address, which lasted more than two and a half hours. It was a chilly early morning in San Jose. The \"pregame\" started at 6:30 a.m. with breakfast from Denny's, the restaurant where Huang came up with the idea for Nvidia. I needed to know who would show up more than three hours early for a speech about computer chips. When I arrived just before 7 a.m., the line was already substantial. A massive red mobile Denny's kitchen was cooking up \"Nvidia bytes\" — essentially sausages and pancakes. Diners were encouraged to wrap up their bytes like a taco and add syrup on top, like Huang does. I chatted with some of the early birds. Some were die-hard Nvidia fans. Some were jet-lagged, having flown in the day before from London or Toronto, so they were up anyway. Some wanted to get into the SAP Center as soon as the stadium doors opened to avoid the massive lines that would form the hour before the speech. Some heard a rumor that Huang himself might stop by the tailgate. And sure enough, by 7:25 a.m., muscled men in suits with earpieces started multiplying. With no fanfare, Huang walked out from behind the registration tent wearing his signature uniform, all black and a leather moto jacket. The bleary-eyed crowds sprung into action — phones up for photos. Huang donned an apron and went inside the food truck to make some pancakes, as he had as a 15-year-old Denny's employee. \"At this pace, I'd run the company out of business. I used to be a lot faster,\" he said of his chef skills after emerging from the kitchen and immediately meeting CNBC reporter Kristina Partsinevelos and a camera crew. Partsinevelos tried to ground the conversation, but Huang was all jokes. \"You're talking about the stock? I'm talking about Denny's!\" he said. By 8:15 a.m., Huang disappeared into the SAP Center, where he turned up on the pre-show panel airing live inside the stadium. As I reached my floor seat, the panel was giving a reverent retrospective of the company — including its many brushes with failure before AI changed everything. Leading up to the speech, Nvidia's partner companies were eager to find out if they would garner a mention on one of tech's brightest stages. One Nvidia employee told me that up to the last minute, a local war room of Nvidia employees was tweaking the company's dozens of announcements. Once the speech starts, it was all in Huang's hands. He kicked off by firing T-shirts into the crowd from an Nvidia-green T-shirt cannon. \"I just want you to know that I'm up here without a net. There are no scripts, there's no teleprompter, and I've got a lot of things to cover. So let's get started,\" Huang said. The 62-year-old CEO proceeded to blow through his scheduled two hours. He focused on Nvidia's advancements, a flurry of new partnerships and software tools for AI developers, and coming chip architectures that could underpin the computation speed and efficiency that creates new industries. These are already creating what Huang calls \"AI Factories.\" He also spoke on the challenges of realizing the AI-enabled future he has promised for years. He addressed shortages of fresh data to feed AI models, limitations in the ever-important training phase, and energy constraints. The world of computing has reached a \"tipping point,\" and the \"platform shift\" to accelerated computing is well underway, he said. The crowd stayed rapt, although a little antsy at the two-hour mark. But the final video clip reenergized the room. A Disney-designed robot named Blue, which looked like part of the Star Wars universe, toddled through a desert and then ascended — for real — from below the stage. Then the crowd jumped to their feet and raised their phones. \"Have a great GTC! Thank you! Hey, Blue, let's go home. Good job,\" said Jensen. After the speech, thousands of attendees streamed into the downtown San Jose streets. The SAP Center, which had only a few empty seats, holds 17,500, and 25,000 people were expected at this year's event. The crowds made their way back to Plaza de Cesar Chavez, temporarily renamed GTC Park, to find lunch at the procession of food trucks on-site daily. Attendees again had to wait in long lines. The lunch lines were just one of many signs that GTC has outgrown its traditional home. Lines to get into the San Jose Convention Center's conference sessions snaked through the hallways. Nvidia still calls GTC a developer conference, though the evolution from technical developer confab to serious dealmaking destination was on display at a swanky building next to the convention center dedicated only to business meetings. The elevators couldn't handle the volume of people constantly coming in and out. Even Nvidia team members arriving just behind me balked and abandoned ship to relocate when they saw the lines. Getting from the sidewalk to the meeting room inside the building took 35 minutes. \"The only way to hold more people at GTC is we're going to have to grow San Jose, and we're working on it,\" said Huang during the keynote. Logistics aside, I soon met with Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of healthcare, who detailed the many ways Nvidia's accelerated computing is changing how doctors and hospitals work. She said it could be decades before robots can actually perform surgeries without human assistance. But companies like Moon Surgical are already creating surgical assistance robots to hold cameras and tools with arms that never tire. Nvidia also works with da Vinci robots, which can suture wounds, among other tasks. I then headed back to the convention center to walk the exhibition floor during happy hour, where I saw some of the technology Powell championed on display. Because Nvidia's impact spans many industries, the floor showcased cars, vacuuming robots, simulated human bodies ready for surgery, and all the biggest names in cloud computing. I also passed the Nvidia gear store, which was booming. A worker there told me the 2025 GTC T-shirt and puffer vests were the biggest sellers. My 12-hour Tuesday at the conference ended at the GTC Night Market back in the park. The setup was an homage to Huang's love of Taiwan's night markets, with live music, drinks, local food like bao buns, yakitori, cupcakes, and a punnily-named \"juice\" bar sponsored by GPU cloud provider Coreweave. If Nvidia has its way, AI is going to continue to do a lot of hard work for us going forward. But 12 hour-days are here to stay, at least for a while. On my way back to my hotel — via San Jose bike share past a now-silent SAP Center — I thought of these two I had spotted inside the convention center: Have a tip?

    "full_content": "A Taiwanese shipbuilding firm has debuted a new uncrewed surface vessel that it said was inspired by Ukraine's attacks on Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Named the Endeavor Manta, the 28-foot-long sea drone is meant to fire light torpedoes and ram into targets with explosives on its bow, the Taiwan International Shipbuilding Corporation, or CSBC, said on Tuesday. The drone's debut comes as Taiwan has pushed hard into designing, purchasing, and building more uncrewed vehicles to potentially counter any aggression from China. Should Beijing seek to take the self-governed island by force, the effort would likely require sending troops on a perilous amphibious assault across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait. CSBC said the Endeavor Manta was built with versatility in mind: It's designed to be launched at any port or beach in Taiwan and can be carried on the back of a commercial truck. The firm touted the Endeavor Manta as an all-purpose platform that can be used as a port inspector, loitering munition, drone jammer, mine-hunter, recon vehicle, decoy, short-range air defense, or even a mothership for smaller drones. \"In severe weather or maritime accidents, it assists with firefighting, search and rescue, and emergency supply transportation,\" the firm added, publishing a concept image of the drone spitting water on a burning ship. Per CSBC, the Endeavor Manta can be controlled using 4G, satellite, and radio signals, and can return autonomously to its launch point or self-destruct if it's jammed or hijacked. The Endeavor Manta has a fiber-reinforced plastic hull and displaces about five tons of water, so it's a relatively small naval craft. By comparison, Taiwan's Anping-class patrol boats displace about 600 tons, while its Cheng-Kung-class light frigates displace around 3,200 tons. CSBC said its new drone can also reach a top speed of 35 knots, or roughly 40 miles per hour. Given the vessel's size, it's highly likely any torpedo would have to be fitted externally. Images of the Endeavor Manta on display at Kaohsiung's Singda Port show that several of its sensors and cameras are mounted on a raised platform above the drone's hull. While CSBC said the drone was \"influenced by the Ukraine-Russia War,\" the Taiwan Strait's waters can be choppier than in the Black Sea. To give the Endeavor Manta more stability, it designed the drone with a trimaran hull. Based on footage released by CSBC of the Endeavor Manta, the drone appears to have a cabin and steering controls for a pilot if needed. CSBC's chairman, Huang Zhenghong, told local TV that the drone is built with a \"red-free\" supply chain, meaning it contains no components from mainland China. The Endeavor Manta joins a growing Taiwanese arsenal of sea and aerial drones aimed at frustrating a Chinese amphibious invasion. Ukraine's own successes against Russia's Black Sea Fleet, which it crippled through sea drone attacks and long-range strikes, have been a stark demonstration of how uncrewed vehicles can be effective against a traditional navy that's stronger on paper. Over a third of the fleet has been destroyed since 2022. Taipei and Washington have been closely watching the Black Sea battle. Adm. Samuel Paparo, who leads the US Indo-Pacific Command, said in June that he wanted to turn the Taiwan Strait into an \"unmanned hellscape\" that could buy Taiwan a month for the US to respond to any Chinese aggression. That same month, Taiwanese media reported that local shipbuilding company Jong Shyn was using a 20-ton uncrewed vessel as a test platform for building exploding sea drones and other tools. Tensions between China and Taiwan have continued to worsen as Beijing says it won't rule out annexing the island by force and repeatedly conducts military exercises threatening Taipei. Meanwhile, Taiwan's people in 2024 once again elected leaders from the Democratic Progressive Party, which has staunchly campaigned against resisting China.",

    "full_content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — The Chinese military conducted large-scale drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan on Tuesday that included an aircraft carrier battle group, as it again warned the self-ruled democracy against seeking formal independence. The exercises involved navy, air ground and rocket forces and were meant to be a “severe warning and forceful containment against Taiwan independence,” according to Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command. No operational name for the drills was announced nor previous notice given. Advertisement Advertisement China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, while most Taiwanese favor their de facto independence and democratic status. Any conflict could bring in the U.S., which maintains alliances in the region and is legally bound to treat threats to Taiwan as a matter of “grave concern.” Read More: What to Know About U.S.-Taiwan Relations Under Trump Taiwan’s Presidential Office posted on X that “China’s blatant military provocations not only threaten peace in the #Taiwan Strait but also undermine security in the entire region, as evidenced by drills near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines & the SCS. We strongly condemn China’s escalatory behavior.” The SCS refers to the South China Sea, the strategic and disputed waterway that China claims almost in its entirety. China’s navy also recently held drills near Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no warning, forcing the last-minute rerouting of commercial flights. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said it had tracked 19 Chinese navy vessels around the island in a 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday. It added that the Shandong aircraft carrier group had entered into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, a self-defined area tracked by the military. Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of these exercises. Taiwanese officials have recently warned that China could launch a sneak attack under the guise of military exercises. Read More: China’s ‘Punishment’ Military Drills Concern Even Taiwan’s Beijing-Friendly Party “I want to say these actions amply reflect (China’s) destruction of regional peace and stability,” said Taiwan’s Defense Minister Wellington Koo. Taiwan has set up a central response group to monitor the latest exercises, Koo said. On the streets of Taipei, people said the atmosphere was tense but they were more concerned about the economy and developments surrounding the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. “The Chinese Communists spend so much time and effort on these things but most people don’t pay much attention,” said Lin Hui-tsung, a noodle seller in the Tiananmu district. China’s Xinhua News Agency said the Eastern Theater Command conducted “multi-subject drills in waters to the north, south and east of Taiwan Island.” The theater command “organized its vessel and aircraft formations, in coordination with conventional missile troops and long-range rocket launching systems, to conduct drills of air interception, assault on maritime targets, strikes on ground objects, and joint blockade and control,” Xinhua quoted the command as saying. The exercises were “aimed at testing the troops’ capabilities of carrying out integrated operations, seizure of operational control and multi-directional precision strikes, the command said. “The PLA organized naval and air forces to practice subjects such as sea and land strikes, focusing on testing the troops’ ability to carry out precision strikes on some key targets of the Taiwan authorities from multiple directions,” said Zhang Chi, a professor at China’s National Defense University in an interview with Chinese state television. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said the exercises were directed at Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s strongly pro-independence president. “Lai Ching-te stubbornly insists on a ‘Taiwan independence’ stance, brazenly labeling the mainland as a ‘foreign hostile force,’ and has put forward a so-called ‘17-point strategy’ … stirring up anti-China sentiments,” China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement. “We will not tolerate or condone this in any way and must resolutely counter and severely punish these actions.” Read More: Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te Is Standing His Ground In mid-March, Taiwan’s Lai put forward a 17-point strategy aimed at shoring up Taiwan’s security. The points include allowing espionage cases to be tried by military courts and making immigration rules stricter for Chinese citizens applying for permanent residency. China’s PLA also released a series of videos to publicize their military exercise, including one in which they depict Lai as a green parasite “poisoning” the island by hatching smaller parasites. The video shows Lai’s head on the body of a bulbous green worm, with a pair of chopsticks picking him up and roasting him over a flame set over Taiwan. The U.S. said China’s actions were only worsening tensions. “Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk. In the face of China’s intimidation tactics and destabilizing behavior, the United States’ enduring commitment to our allies and partners, including Taiwan, continues,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. “The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including through force or coercion.” Taiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but tensions have risen since 2016, when China cut off almost all contacts with Taipei. In the Philippines, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. asked Filipino forces to prepare to rescue Filipinos working and living in Taiwan if China invades the island, speaking during a ceremony marking the founding anniversary of the military command that secures the Philippine region closest to Taiwan. “If something happens to Taiwan, inevitably we will be involved. There are 250,000 overseas Filipino workers in Taiwan and we will have to rescue them,” Brawner said. —Wu reported from Bangkok.

    "full_content": "Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain may have been for naught with the Trump administration's new tariffs that target multiple countries where Apple sources components for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Apple has worked to move some of its manufacturing to countries like India, Vietnam, and Thailand, all of which are facing steep tariffs in addition to China and Taiwan. There is a minimum 10 percent tariff for all U.S. trading partners, and \"reciprocal tariffs\" on several countries where Apple suppliers are located. Some of the tariffs: As The New York Times notes, Apple is already contending with a 20 percent tariff in China, which is set to increase significantly. Taiwan, where Apple sources the Apple silicon chips that go into all of its devices, is facing a 32 percent tariff. The last time Trump was in office, Apple was able to get tariff exemptions or avoid tariffs entirely for some products, but Trump claims that he will not provide exemptions this time around. Morgan Stanley estimates that devices imported from China will cost Apple an additional $8.5 billion annually without exemptions, though it is not clear if Apple would pass those costs to consumers with price increases. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that the United States is not able to compete with China and other countries when it comes to manufacturing due to a lack of skilled workers with expertise in advanced tooling. Apple stock is down 7.5 percent in after hours trading after the tariff announcements. The tariffs will go into effect on April 9, according to Trump.

See our ethics statement. Canon has announced an updated version of its EOS R50 with improved video capabilities, a smaller body, and a cheaper price tag — thanks in part to losing an electronic viewfinder. The original, which launched in 2023, was an entry-level mirrorless camera with 4K video capabilities that maxed out at 30fps. The new EOS R50 V bumps that to 4K at 60fps and borrows some features from the video-focused PowerShot V1 point-and-shoot Canon announced in February. The Canon EOS R50 V will be available sometime in April at $649.99 (the original debuted at $680) for the camera body alone. It will also be sold in an $849.99 bundle that includes Canon’s new RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 lens featuring optical image stabilization and powered zoom capabilities controlled by a ring instead of a button or a lever. Canon says the use of a ring makes it easier to smoothly control the lens’s zoom, whether using the camera in portrait or landscape modes or while shooting selfie videos. The camera features the same 24.2-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor as the original EOS R50 and uses Canon’s Dual Pixel AF II system with focus breathing compensation that can also be found on the EOS R6 Mark II and the PowerShot V1. New video recording modes include options for slow or fast shutters depending on the type of action being captured. There’s also a video mode with electronic stabilization to smooth out footage captured while the camera is moving, but there’s still no in-body image stabilization. Where the EOS R50 V differs from its predecessor is a complete lack of a built-in flash and no electronic viewfinder. Framing shots is all done either on an external screen or using the three-inch articulated touchscreen on the back of the camera. The EOS R50 V is also much easier to use in either vertical or landscape modes thanks to a redesigned grip, an additional tripod screw mount on the side of the camera, and a second video record button on the front. Four different livestreaming modes are supported, accessible through a dedicated button, including HDMI and support for Canon’s Camera Connect and Switcher Mobile apps. Although the EOS R50 V may seem like an affordable cinema camera solution for filmmakers, its somewhat limited capabilities make it better suited for video content creators looking for an upgrade to the PowerShot V1 that will let them swap lenses. Alongside today’s EOS R50 V news, Canon has also announced global availability for the PowerShot V1. The point-and-shoot was initially announced in February 2025 with a late April launch for a limited number of countries including Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Canon says that same shipping timeline will now include the US, with the camera priced at $899.99.

    "full_content": "Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Sen. John Fetterman on Wednesday. And Bibi’s gift to the senator from Pennsylvania is likely to raise more than a few eyebrows. Fetterman was presented with a silver-plated pager, apparently in reference to the terror attack orchestrated by Israel that targeted thousands of Hezbollah members in Lebanon late last year using pagers rigged with explosives. “This is a silver-plated beeper. The real beeper is like one-tenth the weight. But it changes history,” Netanyahu told Fetterman. Fetterman’s response to Netanyahu while holding the ghoulish memento was one of tremendous thanks. “When that story broke, I was like, ‘Oh, I love it. I love it.’ And now it’s like, thank you for this,” Fetterman said. Israel’s terror attack killed at least 42 people, including an 8-year-old and an 11-year-old, and injured about 3,250 more, including 200 critically. Israel built the pagers themselves in a major operation, producing the devices through a manufacturer in Taiwan and selling them to Hezbollah without any indication they were behind the deal. The attack was denounced by experts at the UN as a violation of international law. âThese attacks violate the human right to life, absent any indication that the victims posed an imminent lethal threat to anyone else at the time,â the group of experts said in a statement at the time. âSuch attacks require prompt, independent investigation to establish the truth and enable accountability for the crime of murder.” Netanyahu gave President Donald Trump two similar commemorative pagers back in February, one gold and another described as “normal.” Elon Musk, the billionaire oligarch currently destroying the U.S. federal government, appeared to be pictured near one of the pagers in the Oval Office shortly after it was given to Trump. Defenders of Israel’s attacks tried to justify the tactic by suggesting that everyone who was killed or injured deserved it. But experts pointed out that such a large-scale attack against thousands of devices without knowing who was actually holding the devices was a terrible violation of international laws. âTo the extent that international humanitarian law applies, at the time of the attacks there was no way of knowing who possessed each device and who was nearby,â the UN experts said. âSimultaneous attacks by thousands of devices would inevitably violate humanitarian law, by failing to verify each target, and distinguish between protected civilians and those who could potentially be attacked for taking a direct part in hostilities.” âSuch attacks could constitute war crimes of murder, attacking civilians, and launching indiscriminate attacks, in addition to violating the right to life,” the experts concluded. \nBenjamin NetanyahuGazaGaza WarHezbollahJohn FettermanLebanon  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem says people shouldn't try to \"hide behind the First Amendment.\"\n         \n          Trumpâs comments about turning Gaza into a resort have inspired hellish AI videos and memecoins.\n         \n          The tech giant is facing pushback from employees following a report that it's making a lot of money helping Israel decide where to drop bombs in Gaza.\n         \n          Musk admitted X is throttling links but this is a new level of weird.\n         \n          It took years, three different shell companies, and an explosive called pentaerythritol tetranitrate, according to reports.\n         \n          Beirut said that the new explosions have killed 9 and injured 300.",

    "full_content": "President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs are here, and they could mean increased prices on a variety of goods Americans rely on. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order announcing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, set to go into effect on Saturday, as well as a reciprocal-tariff strategy. The announcement sent global markets plummeting. Trump said countries would be charged \"approximately half\" of what they have been charging the US. (Tariffs are taxes that US importers pay, not ones individual countries pay.) The tariffs apply to nations with which the US has the highest trade deficits and take effect next week on Wednesday. The reciprocal tariff on goods from China is 34%. That's on top of the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods, meaning the total effective tariff rate on Chinese goods now stands at 54%. The announcement sets a 49% tariff for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, and 44% for Sri Lanka. The reciprocal goods tariff is 32% for Taiwan and 26% for India. The European Union has been hit with a 20% tariff. Trump also announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US. He did not mention any new tariffs on Canada or Mexico during his remarks. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" Trump said. He said of his motivation for the reciprocal tariffs: \"They do it to us, and we do it to them — very simple. Can't get any simpler than that.\" In the weeks leading up to Wednesday, Trump signaled various tariffs he was planning to implement. They included a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, a 25% tariff on all car and car part imports into the US, tariffs on agricultural goods, and reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have placed tariffs on US goods. A 25% levy on steel and aluminum imports is already in effect. These tariffs are likely to increase the prices of affected goods. While some companies might choose to absorb some of the costs, consumers are set to shoulder most of the burden. Markets and consumers have already been feeling financial strains due to the uncertainty with Trump's trade plans. The US is likely to face retaliatory tariffs following Trump's announcement. The leaders of multiple countries, including Canada and China, vowed they would be taking countermeasures but did not immediately provide details. In a video address on Thursday, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that tariffs \"make things work worse, not better,\" and that the EU was ready to take \"firm countermeasures if necessary.\" She added: \"Our immediate response to tariffs is unity and determination.\" The United Auto Workers union previously praised the president's plan to place a 25% tariff on all cars and car parts imported into the US, saying it would bring more jobs back into the US auto industry. \"These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country,\" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. Correction: April 3, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the reciprocal tariff rate on China. It is 34%, not 32%.",

    "full_content": "Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap. Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap. by  Tina Nguyen and  Kylie Robison AI companies can’t figure out if the Trump tariffs are about to decimate them – and the fact that no one has a clear answer is sending them, and the tech industry overall, into a confusion spiral.  The markets are in disarray. Nvidia is down 7.59%, TSMC is down 7.22%. In San Francisco, sources tell us that this isn’t a big deal. But in DC, people are panicking. The core question is whether GPUs – the graphics processing units that are crucial to AI computing and other industries – are exempted from Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and the answer is startlingly ambiguous.  Inside AI labs, researchers expect that their industry will be granted a tariff exemption. “I fully expect this to be a situation where Trump again gives companies he views as important/on his side/whatever a hall pass,” similar to what the President did with Apple during his first term, one source inside a major AI lab told The Verge.  In Washington, however, nobody seems sure what the current state of play is. The Trump administration spelled out an exception for the semiconductor chips at the heart of a GPU, but for now, complete electronic products that contain chips will apparently be subject to tariffs. And companies that need GPUs for machine learning, deep learning, real-time processing, and much more require not just the chip, but the entire machine built around it. “Most AI GPUs are, I believe, imported not as chips but as servers, largely from Taiwan,” Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, told The Verge in an email. “So these would presumably face the general Taiwan tariff rate” of 32%, currently scheduled to hit on April 9th. Ordinarily, government agencies might be able to explain what’s happening. But when asked for clarity, a public affairs official at NIST, the agency at the Commerce Department overseeing the CHIPS Act – a $50 billion investment in building chip manufacturing plants on American soil – directed The Verge to the White House. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did the U.S. Trade Representative, the agency responsible for creating and executing the President’s tariff strategy.  While the SF crowd is bullish on getting exemptions, tech lobbyists in Washington are closer to the chaos that is the second Trump administration, and are far too familiar with the president’s mercurial whims and vindictive nature, particularly against the tech industry. The fact that the tariffs are so vague and seem haphazardly thrown together – so haphazard, in fact, that there’s a legitimate argument that they were generated by AI – is only adding to their worries. “Everyone’s asking for clarity” from the administration, one lobbyist at a major tech company told The Verge. “So far, folks are saying that they think we’re okay, but not sure yet.” That’s not exactly a ringing vote of confidence for GPU tariff exemptions.  The GPU confusion is rippling beyond the AI industry, hitting the Big Tech companies that stock thousands of these devices in datacenters across the country. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all rely on access to GPUs to prop up their multi-billion dollar cloud architectures. Clearly, the market isn’t confident that their bottom line will weather these tariffs: The so-called “Magnificent Seven”, which includes the three companies above, have lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since the tariffs were announced. (Spokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment for this story.)  The AI industry has reason to think Trump might favor it in particular. Just a few months ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and other tech CEOs stood in the White House alongside the president to announce Stargate, a $500 billion datacenter infrastructure project devoted to fulfilling Altman’s demands for “more compute.” The current unclear state of GPUs coupled with the unpredictability of Trump’s tariffs in general, however, could shake their confidence — or at least mean they must renew attempts to curry Trump’s favor. “If the tariffs are unchanged, we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.” GPU juggernaut Nvidia has apparently begun moving manufacturing to the US, which it hopes will help insulate it from the tariffs. Reuters reported last December, for instance, that it was finalizing plans to produce its Blackwell AI GPU chip at TSMC’s Arizona plant, which aims to start fabricating chips this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang alluded to this partnership in a recent investor Q&A: “We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around. Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.”  The same can’t be said for compute-hungry AI labs, hyperscale cloud providers, or even average PC builders — all of whom might end up paying substantially more for GPUs. “None of this is impossible, but trying to produce every segment of electronics supply chains domestically will produce a staggering increase in cost, especially in the short-term, given that some of the capabilities simply don’t exist domestically,” Miller said. That doesn’t even take into account the tariffs on the raw materials needed to build these machines and plants, or any retaliatory measures: on Friday, for instance, China announced a new set of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for electronics manufacturing. The U.S. currently imports 90 percent of its rare earth minerals from China. “If the tariffs are unchanged,” Miller added, “we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.” But ultimately, fealty to Trump might be more crucial than an appeal to reason. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged allegiance to the new administration, which is important for Anthropic, since it sources some of its compute through Amazon. These deals are fragile, though. A single critical story in Bezos’ paper The Washington Post could lose Amazon (and by association, Anthropic) a tariff exemption, for instance. Anthropic also sources some of its compute through Google; along with Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai joined the gaggle of tech billionaires behind Trump at his inauguration. And there are other factors that could indirectly cause problems for these companies, of course — like the US being pushed into a recession that devastates the tech economy. “The second order effects of the tariffs could still be bad,” the AI lab source added. The market tumbles seemed to have mobilized tech leaders. A group of tech CEOs and finance leaders are on their way to Trump’s private resort, Mar-a-Lago, according to journalist Kara Swisher. The goal seems to be to find some sense in these tariffs — and perhaps some exemptions.

    "full_content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s President William Lai Ching-te said that a Taiwanese semiconductor company's massive investment in Arizona is the “best model” for the island's effort to build computer chips supply lines that don't rely on Chinese producers, in remarks to the state’s visiting Governor Katie Hobbs. Taiwan’s leading chipmaker TSMC has committed $100 billion to build three chip foundries, an R&D center and two packaging facilities in Arizona, on top of a previous pledge to build $65 billion in three chip foundries in the state, one of which has begun operations. Lai and TSMC say that the latest mega-investment stemmed from customer demand and not pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump. Trump previously said that Taiwan had taken away the U.S. chip business and that he wanted it back. At their Tuesday meeting, Lai said Taiwan and Arizona were working to build a “non-red” supply chain that excluded suppliers from China, which threatens military action to assert its claim over the island. TSMC has said the development plans in the U.S. would not affect its work in Taiwan, and that the company currently has 10,000 employees researching and developing 1.0 nanometer chips. Taiwan accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production. The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider. News about the meeting was released Wednesday by Taiwan's official Central News Agency. The project is expected to create 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years and tens of thousands of tech and manufacturing jobs, Hobbs’ office said in a news release sent before the meeting. “I’m thrilled by Arizona’s emergence as America’s hub for advanced manufacturing, creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and bringing billions of dollars of investment into our state,” Hobbs said in the release. CNA quoted Hobbs as saying that the TSMC project would “not only contribute to the global advancement of artificial intelligence and other technologies, but also strengthen bilateral ties.”",

    "full_content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China has lashed out at accusations it is endangering maritime safety made by top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies in a joint statement, saying the G7 members are “filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions.” Even for China's generally overheated diplomatic language, the statement issued Saturday was unusually vitriolic, although it did not threaten any retaliation. In the Friday statement that sparked the Chinese response, the G7 said, “We condemn China’s illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions that seek unilaterally to alter the status quo in such a way as to risk undermining the stability of regions, including through land reclaimations, and building of outposts, as well as their use for military purpose.” “We reaffirm that our basic policies on Taiwan remain unchanged and emphasize the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity,” the statement said, referring to the crucial waterway separating China from the self-governing island republic it claims as its own territory. In the response issued through its embassy in Canada, where the two-day G7 meeting was held in La Malbaie, Quebec, China said the statement “repeated the same old rhetoric, ignored facts and China’s solemn position, grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs, and blatantly smeared China.” “The statements are filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions to suppress and attack China. China strongly deplores and opposes this and has lodged solemn representations with the Canadian side,” the statement said. China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, through which passes around $5 trillion in global trade. It has dismissed and occasionally clashed with other countries that claim parts of the sea, especially the Philippines, a U.S. treaty partner. China is not a member of the G7 but closely follows all comments and references to its international status made by international organizations or in foreign countries, responding to criticism with caustic language. China has firmly rejected a U.N.-affiliated court's ruling that invalidated most of its claims to the South China Sea and says its claim to Taiwan is non-negotiable, even if China has to use force against the island. China routinely sends ships and warplanes into airspace and waters near Taiwan, built military bases on human-made islands in the South China Sea and recently staged surprise live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no advance notice. Australia's aviation authority said it learned of the drills just 30 minutes before they began, not from Beijing but from a pilot flying in the area, and 49 commercial flights were forced to alter their flight paths in response. The G7 did not mention the drills in its statement. “We share a growing concern at recent, unjustifiable efforts to restrict such freedom and to expand jurisdiction through use of force and other forms of coercion, including across the Taiwan Strait, and in the South China Sea, the Red Sea, and the Black Sea,” the G7 said. China has the world's largest navy, including three aircraft carriers, with a fourth on the way. It has a base in Sheikhdom of Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and consistently has expanded the range of the force.",

    "full_content": "The laptop maker Framework is pausing US sales of some of its lower-end models, citing President Donald Trump's tariffs. Framework, a San Francisco-based company known for its modular and upgradable laptops, announced Tuesday that certain base systems in its Laptop 13 series would be removed from its US site and their sales temporarily halted. \"Due to the new tariffs that came into effect on April 5th, we're temporarily pausing US sales on a few base Framework Laptop 13 systems (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U),\" the company said on X. \"For now, these models will be removed from our US site. We will continue to provide updates as we have them.\" In response to a user asking for more information, the company cited the 32% reciprocal tariff that Trump levied against Taiwan. \"We priced our laptops when tariffs on imports from Taiwan were 0%,\" the company said. \"At a 10% tariff, we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss. Other consumer goods makers have performed the same calculations and taken the same actions, though most have not been open about it.\" Framework isn't the first company to hit the pause button on some of its US sales while evaluating the ramifications of Trump's tariff blitz. Nintendo, which manufactures largely in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, has pushed back US preorders of its highly anticipated Switch 2 to an undetermined date (though it says the game console will still launch on June 5). The British automaker Jaguar Land Rover has stopped shipping its cars to the States, citing a new 25% tariff on automobiles. A Framework spokesperson told Business Insider that no other information was available and that the company would provide updates as it received them. Framework brands itself around making electronics that are inherently customizable and repairable — it's on a mission to improve consumer electronics, which it describes as \"broken.\" \"Our philosophy is that by making well-considered design tradeoffs and trusting customers and repair shops with the access and information they need, we can make fantastic devices that are still easy to repair,\" its site says. Its Laptop 16, for instance, allows for plenty of user fiddling — the keyboard, ports, and discrete graphics processing unit can all be swapped out, depending on a customer's preference.",

    "full_content": "seUnited Airlines has been approved to begin operating flights with onboard Starlink satellite internet service. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the airline a certificate to operate the service on its fleet of Embraer 175 aircraft, with United expecting to install the SpaceX service on all 300 of the regional jets by the end of the year. Starlink will be a free service for UnitedPlus members, which is essentially all passengers as the loyalty program is free to join. United and Starlink announced last year that the airline would outfit its entire fleet of more than 1,000 aircraft with Starlink in the next few years. SpaceX has been on something of a tear recently, signing deals with numerous partners to offer Starlink beyond rural households, including partnering with T-Mobile and cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean. Beyond United, it has also signed deals to offer in-flight WiFi with Hawaiian and private jet operator JSX. The service is not expected to work well in densely populated areas as high-speed fiber is already available, and a singular Starlink satellite would likely not have enough bandwidth to serve many users simultaneously. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said Starlink would likely never be suitable in urban environments where high-speed internet access is already plentiful. Starlink is expected to reach more than $11 billion in revenue in 2025, buoyed by government and commercial contracts. It helps essentially subsidize the cost of SpaceX rocket launches, as the company can send up new Starlink satellites with each payload. Airlines are eager to offer the service as existing offerings from the likes of Gogo have been notoriously slow and unreliable, resulting in frequent complaints on social media from customers who pay $10-20 for a WiFi pass only to find the service does not work. Starlink can offer broadband-like speeds thanks to its constellation of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO), though latency is high due to the inherent nature of sending requests to space and back. It is somewhat surprising that airlines are willing to eat the cost of providing Starlink service considering the business model of “unbundling” airline tickets and charging extra for each perk. It would be unsurprising to see airlines eventually throttle the service and upcharge for faster speeds. Being associated with Elon Musk, Starlink comes with some baggage. Where the service has been able to supply crucial internet access in locations such as Ukraine, countries in Asia and Europe have expressed some reservations about relying on internet service controlled by a close confidant of President Trump. Europe is developing its own Eutelsat alternative, while Taiwan has similarly been exploring other options out of concern regarding Musk’s ties to China for Tesla sales. In Canada, the province of Ontario recently canceled a $100 million Starlink contract in retaliation over U.S. tariffs. Musk may be able to secure lucrative government contracts domesticallyâand the Treasury Secretary has pushed to use Starlink in the government’s rural internet access programâbut his newfound influence is a double-edged sword. Musk’s empire is exposed to geopolitical conflict being so close to President Trump. \nElon MuskSPACEXstarlinksUnited Airlines  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The destruction of the Trump regime will be felt for generations.\n         \n          Good luck getting your grandparents on X.\n         \n          Tesla's factory in Shanghai only produces the carmaker's more affordable models, with the Model S and X imported from the U.S.\n         \n          A senior official describes the billionaire as an awkward and obnoxious asshole.\n         \n          Once again, the Trump admin is pulling back from a dumbass move.\n         \n          An audit of DOGEâs handling of data at federal agencies is reportedly underway.",

    "full_content": "Apple's custom silicon chips will begin to be manufactured in the United States at an accelerated pace as TSMC adjusts its timelines, although the chips produced domestically will be limited to older models for the foreseeable future, Nikkei Asia reports. Exclusive Apple chip supplier TSMC has confirmed that future fabrication facilities in the United States will be brought online more quickly than its first Arizona-based plant, which was beset by delays. TSMC now expects new U.S. plants to take no more than two years to complete, a significant improvement over the five-year timeline required for its initial facility. Despite the expedited pace, the chips produced in these new plants will not power Apple's latest models, as the most advanced fabrication processes will remain exclusive to TSMC's operations in Taiwan. The company's first U.S. plant, located in Phoenix, Arizona, began construction in 2020 and is expected to begin production in 2025. This facility is configured to produce chips using TSMC's N4 process, which is part of the broader 5-nanometer node family. This generation includes the A16 Bionic chip, originally introduced in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Pro and later used in the iPhone 15, ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, and the latest entry-level iPad. The S9 chip used in the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is also an N4 chip. These chips are no longer at the top of Apple's product line technologically and their production today simply supports continued manufacturing of the company's older or lower-end models. TSMC has announced plans for a second Arizona plant that will support production of 3-nanometer chips, currently the most advanced node in mass production and used for chips like the A17 Pro, M3, A18, and M4. However, this second facility will not begin operations until 2028, at which point Apple's mainstream devices will likely have moved to 2-nanometer or more advanced silicon. A third facility, expected to produce chips with the 2-nanometer process, is planned for completion before the end of the decade, though TSMC has not committed to a specific timeline beyond \"before 2030.\" Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the first 2nm Apple chip to be the \"A20,\" debuting in the ‌iPhone‌ 18 lineup next year, again suggesting that the U.S. chips will lag well behind the technological requirements of future high-end Apple devices. The disparity between US and Taiwanese chip production timelines is partially a result of TSMC's longstanding technical and organizational infrastructure in Taiwan, where all research and development continues to take place. The company's semiconductor dominance is also considered by some analysts to act as a \"silicon shield,\" deterring potential military aggression from China by making Taiwan's stability a matter of international economic importance.

    "full_content": "On 2 April US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs, arguing that they would allow the United States to economically flourish. These new import taxes, which Trump imposed via executive order, have sent shockwaves through global markets as they kicked in this week. But the US president believes they are necessary to address trading imbalances and to protect American jobs and manufacturing.  Here are the basic elements of the plan. A baseline tariff of 10% on almost all foreign imports to the US kicked in on 5 April. Some countries and goods are exempt, which we'll explain later. The companies which bring the foreign goods into America will have to pay this tax to the US government, although this could have knock-on effects to consumers. Some countries will only face the base rate. These include: White House officials also said that they would impose what they describe as specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the \"worst offenders\". These have come into effect on 9 April.  Trump's officials say these countries charge higher tariffs on US goods, impose \"non-tariff\" barriers to US trade or have otherwise acted in ways they feel undermine American economic goals. Here is a list of key trading partners subject to these customised tariff rates (these figures include the baseline tariff): China is facing the heaviest tariffs, after a 104% levy on Chinese goods imported into the US came into effect on 9 April. China, in turn, has said it will hike its tariff on US goods from 34% to 84%, starting on 10 April.  Separately, Trump has ordered that low-value goods entering the US from Hong Kong and mainland China will be subject to import duties from 1 May onwards. The \"de minimis\" exemption has allowed foreign products costing $800 (£624) or less to enter the US duty-free - but that will no longer apply to Chinese imports. Canada and Mexico, which were targeted in Trump's previous round of tariffs, face no additional levies. The 10% baseline rate does not apply to them. The White House said it would deal with both countries using a framework set out in Trump's previous executive orders, which imposed tariffs on both countries as part of the administration's efforts to address the entry of fentanyl to the US and border issues. Trump previously set those tariffs at 25% on all goods entering from both countries, before announcing some exemptions and delays. While the new round of tariffs applied globally covers most foreign goods entering the US, there are some exemptions. According to the White House's fact sheet, these include copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, bullion, energy and \"other certain materials that are not available in the United States\". Articles subject to a US Code clause, widely interpreted as \"informational materials\", communications and donations, are also exempted. The tariff rates also do not apply to steel, aluminium, vehicles and vehicle parts - but that's because they are subject to separate 25% tariffs on specific sectors.",

    "full_content": "The Denisovans were a mysterious group of archaic humans who likely lived from around 370,000 years ago to at least 30,000 years ago, and are believed to be an offshoot or sister group of the Neanderthals. What little we know about Denisovans is based on a handful of fragmented fossil remains unearthed in Siberia’s Denisova Cave and China’s Tibetan Plateau. A new analysis, however, adds another piece to the Denisovan puzzle. In a study published today in the journal Science, a team of researchers from Japan, Taiwan, and Denmark revealed that a jawbone previously discovered in Taiwan belonged to a male Denisovan. They reached this conclusion after conducting a paleoproteomic analysisâan analysis of ancient proteinsâwhich revealed two protein variants associated with Denisovans. The identification provides the most compelling evidence yet that Denisovans lived across different habitats and adapted to diverse climates. “The high-quality palaeoproteomic data obtained from Penghu 1 [the fossilized jaw], enabled by relatively good fossil preservation and optimized protein extraction methods, indicates that Penghu 1 belonged to a male Denisovan,” the researchers wrote in the study. Fishers dredged up Penghu 1, along with other animal fossils, from the seabed of Taiwan’s Penghu Channelâan area that was part of the Asian mainland during the lower sea levels of the Pleistocene Epoch (2.5 million to 11,700 years ago). According to the study, the jawbone dates to either 10,000 to 70,000 years ago, or 130,000 to 190,000 years ago. The reason for two sets of fairly divergent age ranges has to do with the methods used to date the fossil. Because of the jawbone’s degradation, the team couldnât use direct dating techniques like uranium-series or radiocarbon dating. Instead, the scientists relied on indirect clues, such as the fossilâs chemical composition, the types of animal fossils found nearby, and historical sea-level data. Altogether, this evidence pointed to the two possible time windows. The researchers, sequencing proteins extracted from the jawbone and teeth, recovered 4,241 amino acid residues (the building blocks of protein) and identified two of them as Denisovan-specific variantsâmeaning the jawbone belonged to a Denisovan. This direct molecular evidence of Denisovan presence in modern-day Taiwan supports a theory previously indicated by genetic studies of modern humans: namely, that Denisovans existed in southeastern Asia. One of the few things we know about Denisovans is that they interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans. As such, some people today have genes passed down from distant Denisovan ancestorsâparticularly people from southeastern Asia, suggesting that Denisovans lived and interbred with modern humans there. Before the jawbone’s paleoproteomic analysis, however, Denisovan fossils had only ever been molecularly confirmed from northern Asia. “The identification of Penghu 1 as a Denisovan mandible confirms the inference from modern human genomic studies that Denisovans were widely distributed in eastern Asia,” the researchers explained in the study. What’s more, the “presence of Denisovans in diverse geographical and climatic zones,” ranging from the cold winters of the north, to the high-altitude chill of alpine subarctic zones, to the warm and humid conditions of the tropical lowlands, “demonstrates their adaptational flexibility.” The researchers also conducted morphological analyses on the jawbone, concluding that the Denisovan man had a robust jaw, large molars, and notable root structures. Significantly, these characteristics align with Denisovan fossils from the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting they may represent broader Denisovan traits. Ultimately, the study sheds light on an ancient human relative we still know little about, while expanding our understanding of early human development across southeastern Asia. \ndenisovansGeneticsPaleontology  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          New analysis shows several families of dinosaurs were likely thriving in North America in the latter days of the dinosaur era.\n         \n          Colossal Biosciences' feat of genetic engineering has people talking, but not every scientist is on board with its claim of having brought back the dire wolf.\n         \n          23andMe is potentially selling more than just your genetic dataâthe personal survey info it collected is just as much a privacy problem.\n         \n          About one in five Americans has a genetic risk for a dangerous type of cholesterol.\n         \n          Scientists have debated where Prototaxites belong in the tree of life for over a century, but now a new study suggests it might represent a whole new branch.\n         \n          There's only so much you can learn from a consumer DNA test, and most people simply don't need one.",

    "full_content": "World War Fee US President Donald Trump has imposed a base ten percent tariff on imports into America, and higher levies on goods from major producers of digital tech, such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan. At an event he named “Liberation Day” Wednesday, Trump declared a national emergency on the grounds that the practices of America’s trading partners “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.” The sole example of technology industry practices cited in the Trump administration’s fact sheet and executive order is India charging a ten percent duty on imported American switches and routers, while the USA charges no duty on such networking devices entering its land. The ten percent blanket tariff comes into force on April 5. Four days later, the US will impose “reciprocal tariffs” – levies in response to other countries’ import duties – on many nations. These retaliatory fees, outlined in a list published on the White House’s X account, target several countries known to host significant tech manufacturing industries. Among major hardware-producing nations, Thailand and Malaysia will be hit with the highest reciprocal tariffs - 36 percent - ahead of China at an additional 34 percent and Taiwan at 32 percent. Imports from China are already tariffed at 20 percent and that won't go away. Reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports mean they will cost 26 percent more once they reach the USA, a blow to its ambition to become a global tech manufacturing player. Another aspiring tech player, Vietnam, faces 46 percent reciprocal tariffs. Taiwanese imports will cost 25 percent more by the time they reach US buyers under the reciprocal tariff plan, as will kit from South Korea. Japan and Thailand each face 24 percent reciprocal tariffs. Even Israel, one of the USA’s staunchest allies, will face a 17 percent reciprocal tariff. Everything imported from the European Union will be subject to a 20 percent tariff. One apparent goal of these levies is to encourage manufacturers to make more gear in America so as to avoid these import fees. What's made in the USA will thus be more competitively priced than shipped-in tariff-hit foreign components and products, so buying American costs less in the nation all while lowering revenues for overseas suppliers. Hence why Apple and others have pledged to invest in factories in the United States. It's hard to imagine these tariffs won't, at least in the short-to-mid-term, result in price rises for folks and businesses in America, however, because importers pay the tariffs and will likely protect their profits by passing on the increased costs to buyers in the States. Manufacturers need time to either shift production to stateside factories or build new facilities, all of which involves cost. The alternative is that businesses bringing products into the US take a hit to their profit margins by absorbing the tariffs. If you are in the US, prepare to pay more for foreign-built parts and stuff for now, we reckon. Intel, Apple, and Samsung manufacture in Vietnam. Many hard disk drives are made in Thailand. Dell makes laptops in Malaysia. iPhones are now made in India as well as China. In some good news for Taiwan, a powerhouse of manufacturing thanks to the likes of TSMC, the White House signaled that semiconductors will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs. However, President Trump has previously warned of 100 percent tariffs on imported chips. Copper, pharmaceuticals, lumber, steel and aluminum, some minerals, certain automotive parts, and other bits and pieces, are also spared from reciprocal tariffs. Additionally, Canada and Mexico are exempted from the 10 percent base rate as they are already covered by earlier tough levies imposed by the President. This is a developing story as the administration is yet to publish detailed documentation of its tariff plans, so we can't assess what tariff would apply to a device that includes components made in Taiwan and Vietnam, before being partly assembled in South Korea and completed in the USA. The Register will update this story if more useful material becomes available. ® At time of writing, in after-hours trading already: Apple shares down 7 percent, Amazon down 6, Meta down 5, Nvidia down 5, Microsoft down 3, Alphabet down 4, Cisco down 3, IBM down 2, HPE down 4, HP Inc down 5, Intel down 4, AMD down 5, Arm down 5, Qualcomm down 3, TSMC down 5, Dell down 6... \nPS: 'De minimis' exemptions for imported packages under $800 from China and Hong Kong will end on May 2, affecting Temu, Shein, and similar internet souks.\n Send us news",

    "full_content": "United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino was in charge at Tottenham between 2014 and 2019 and has also managed Paris St-Germain and Chelsea United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino had sections of his former club's fanbase giddy with excitement last week after he declared his desire to one day return to Tottenham. It isn't a new concept, Pochettino has previously been clear in his wish to become Spurs head coach for a second period - but the current conjecture over incumbent Ange Postecoglou's future has sharpened the issue. The Argentine remains a hero among some of the regulars at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Joining in 2014, Pochettino led the team to second and third placed finishes in the Premier League and a Champions League final. Photos of Pochettino sharing a coffee with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, that went viral on social media last week, served only to amplify affections among supporters who pine for his return. The fact the photos are not recent, certainly not taken over the past 10 days, won't quell the fervour. Pochettino is under pressure in his current job. With a home World Cup in 2026 just 15 months away, his US side have lost consecutive Concacaf Nations League matches in the past week - beaten by Panama and Canada. Yet, dig deeper and you realise the prospect of the 53-year-old returning to Spurs any time soon is hugely unlikely. The United States Soccer Federation would be owed what has been described by a well-placed source as \"one of the biggest financial compensation fees in football history\" if Pochettino was to leave for Spurs - or any other team for that matter - before the next World Cup. Chelsea's Â£21m payment to Brighton to land Graham Potter after sacking Thomas Tuchel in 2022 and Bayern Munich's Â£21m to RB Leipzig to pave the way for Julian Nagelsmann's appointment in 2021 are, according to reports, ranked as the two largest managerial compensation packages in history. Pochettino signed a two-year contract in September, with multiple reports stating he earns Â£4.6m a year. However, it is understood the sum US Soccer would recoup if Pochettino leaves before next year's tournament, which they are hosting along with Canada and Mexico, extends way beyond the his salary and much closer to the amount Chelsea and Bayern, respectively, paid to land Potter and Nagelsmann. Would Pochettino return progress Spurs? Pochettino's recent remarks appeared to swing the door open towards him replacing Postecoglou should the Australian lose his job before next season. \"I am in the USA, so I am not going to talk about that now - but what I said then I still, after six years or five years, feel in my heart,\" he said last week. \"Yes, I would like one day to come back.\" However, according to well-placed sources, Pochettino has no immediate wish to return to Spurs. He is said to be fully committed to leading the US to a home World Cup. Of course, the mammoth cost of releasing Pochettino from his current deal lends itself to a singular focus, with the notion of any club - particularly one with a chairman as financially astute as Daniel Levy - parting with such a sizeable sum as being far-fetched. Yet, you get the sense Pocehttino's desire to lead the US to the World Cup is genuine and not a mindset borne out of stipulations relating to his contract. Indeed, during the same interviews in which he re-affirmed his intention to one day return to Tottenham, the South American spoke of his engagement with his new team and the project ahead. \"For us, the pressure is going to be there [at the World Cup] because we are a host,\" he said. \"And then it's a country where the mentality is about winning. In sport, in everything that Americans are involved in, they want to win. \"The players know it's going to be massive pressure and now our president [Trump] likes to put pressure on, but it's welcome. That means we are going to feel the adrenaline we need to feel. We are ready to deliver.\" Tottenham Q&A: Does Postecoglou have a future at Spurs? Much of the hype surrounding Pochettino's hypothetical return to Spurs stems from the fact Postecoglou is by no means certain of remaining in charge heading into next season. Tottenham's disappointing season leaves him under scrutiny. They are in 14th place in the Premier League, having accumulated 34 points. Even if they win all their remaining nine matches, they would still fall short of last season's points total of 66. Their wait for a domestic trophy will extend into next season after being eliminated from both cup competitions. Postecoglou's only saving grace is Tottenham's run in the Europa League; they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals next month. Of course, if Spurs win that competition the season takes on a very different complexion. Not only would success in Europe end the club's 17-year wait for silverware but it would also see them qualify for next season's Champions League. Such a scenario would surely see Postecoglou strengthen his position. That is easier said than done, of course. Indeed, failure to win the Europa League would raise further uncertainty over Postecoglou's job moving forward. All current indications are that Tottenham want to get to the end of the season before reviewing the campaign and come to a decision. Results, though, will likely dictate the club's approach. Sunday's defeat by arch-rivals Canada has taken Pochettino's record as US head coach to five wins and three losses. Prior to the current international break, Pochettino's win ratio since replacing Gregg Berhalter in September was healthier. But losing to Panama - 1-0 in the semi-final of the Concacaf Nations League - and 2-1 to Canada in the third-placed play-off, has led to some negativity. Pochettino quickly moved to quell any disquiet after Sunday's defeat, saying: 'I've seen some times that teams that were building to play in the World Cup, they were not good until around the World Cup. \"I want to send a message to the fans, don't be pessimistic and don't get bad feelings. \"I think we have time because if we will be in this situation in one year time, for sure, I will tell you, 'Houston, we have a problem,' no?\" Pochettino said. \"In one year, if we're talking about that, it's because we have a big problem and we were not capable to discover, to try design a better strategy to provide to the team the capacity to play in a different way.  \"I think we have time and I prefer that that happened today than [you] know, in one year.\" Nevertheless, with around 15 months until the World Cup starts, this month's results will have fans apprehensive.

    "full_content": "Intel ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger has thrown shade on Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC's plans to build fabrication plants in the USA, saying the factories will do nothing to advance American semiconductor leadership. \"If you don't have R&D in the US, you will not have semiconductor leadership in the US,\" Gelsinger said, according to a report this week in the Financial Times. \"All of the R&D work of TSMC is in Taiwan, and they haven't made any announcements to move that,” Gelsinger pointed out, effectively asserting that manufacturing chips using technologies and processes developed outside the USA in a stateside factory means America won't lead the world in semiconductor fabrication. The chips themselves may be designed in the States, and fabbed in the country, but they'll be made using state-of-the-art techniques formulated in Taiwan and elsewhere, where the next-gen nodes will be devised. America at that point will be a useful overseas factory hub rather than a leader, appears to be Pat's argument. Gelsinger, whose tenure at Intel ended in early December when he was abruptly booted out, tried to turn Chipzilla into a contract manufacturing heavyweight capable of challenging market leader TSMC. His grand plan involved Intel spending over $100 billion on new fabs in the US, Europe, and the Middle East, and creating an independent foundry business to build chips for third-party customers and Intel itself. The former CEO hoped Intel’s foundry would be attractive to customers because the company developed an advanced manufacturing process called 18A that is thought to allow creation of chips that near the complexity and performance of products only TSMC has previously been able to fab. The strategy did not produce immediate positive results, as Intel’s foundry business unit recorded substantial losses – and meaningful production using the 18A process is yet to commence. Another sign that the foundry plan was not roaring ahead was the announcement that completion of two Intel fab projects in the US state of Ohio had been delayed until the late 2020s and may not open for business until as late as 2030. Less than a week later, TSMC announced its intention to plow a further $100 billion into chip plants located in the USA, in a bid to insulate its US customers from the threat of Trumpian tariffs. While Gelsinger shares his opinions from the sidelines, Intel’s foundry ambitions are now a matter for newly appointed CEO Lip Bu Tan to consider. He's yet to detail any new strategy publicly, but will have new help to develop one as a Thursday regulatory filing revealed three Intel directors won’t seek reelection. Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak, UC Berkeley College of Engineering Dean Tsu-Jae King Liu, and Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, a former professor at the University of Pennsylvania, will all exit Intel’s board later this year. In Intel’s annual report, which appeared on Thursday, Tan wrote he remains committed to Intel’s foundry ambitions, without explicitly endorsing Gelsinger’s strategy of making Intel a contract manufacturer. “To enable great products, I am equally focused on creating great process technology, which is core to our strategy for building a world-class foundry,” he wrote. \"We are excited to begin high-volume production on Intel 18A at our newest fab in Arizona later this year and look forward to continued work with the US administration to strengthen the country’s technology and manufacturing leadership,\" he said. \"While some companies are returning to the US or investing here for the first time, Intel never left — and we continue to expand our operations.\" ® Send us news",

    "full_content": "By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan prosecutors on Friday for the first time charged a Chinese ship captain with intentionally damaging undersea cables off the island in February, after a rise in sea cable malfunctions alarmed Taiwan officials amid tensions with China. Prosecutors say the man was captain of the Chinese-crewed Hong Tai 58, registered in Togo, which Taiwanese authorities detained after suspecting the ship had dropped anchor near an undersea cable off southwestern Taiwan, damaging it. The prosecutors' office in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan said they had charged the ship's Chinese captain, whom they identified only by his family name, Wang, with being responsible for damaging the cable. Wang has said he is innocent, but refused to provide details of the ship's owner and \"had a bad attitude\", the prosecutors said in a statement. Seven other Chinese nationals detained at the same time will not be charged and will be transported to China, prosecutors said, adding that the case was the island's first prosecution over damaging sea cables. Reuters was not able to determine the ship's ownership or immediately locate a lawyer representing the captain. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has previously accused Taiwan of \"manipulating\" possible Chinese involvement in the case, saying it was casting aspersions before the facts were clear. The cable damage has come on top of China's military activities around Taiwan, including war games, the latest of which Beijing held last week. On Friday, Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected 21 Chinese military aircraft operating near the island, taking part in a \"joint combat readiness drill\" with Chinese warships, something Taipei routinely reports. BLACKLIST Taiwan has reported five cases of sea cable malfunctions this year, compared with three each in 2024 and 2023, according to its digital ministry. Taiwan's coast guard has in recent months stepped up efforts to protect its sea cables, including monitoring a \"blacklist\" of close to 100 China-linked ships registered to a country other than that of its owner near Taiwan, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. Taiwan said in January it suspected a China-linked ship of damaging an undersea cable off its northern coast; the ship owner denied the accusations. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly complained about \"grey zone\" Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging. Taipei was alarmed after another Chinese-linked ship was suspected of damaging a different cable this year, prompting the navy and other agencies to step up efforts to protect the undersea communication links, which are vital to the island's connections to the rest of the world. Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it has experienced and damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Japan's Nikkei soared 9.1%, while South Korea's Kospi jumped 6.6%, taking the Seoul index out of bear market territory. Taiwan's composite index spiked 9.25%, staging a strong comeback just days after it logged its biggest one-day drop on record. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also gained 2%, while key indices in China also rose slightly. But investors are still looking to Beijing for reaction.  Trump not only excluded China from the pause on tariffs, but actually hiked them further, imposing tariffs on the country to a staggering 125% on Chinese exports on Wednesday.  The higher levy came just hours after Beijing announced retaliatory duties of 84% on American goods imported to China. Trump's steeper tariffs had been in effect for only about 12 hours when he said he would suspend them for the next 90 days. The announcement was made during Wall Street trading hours and sent U.S. stocks surging. In a post on Truth Social early Thursday, Trump wrote  \"What a day, but more great days coming!!!\" Analysts say Trump's higher tariffs on China will have a limited impact on the country's economy. T. Rowe Price analyst Wenli Zheng said in a research note that on one of China's main stock markets, Chinese businesses have a \"surprisingly low revenue exposure to the U.S.\" Still, many investors say they would rather see an end to this explosive trade war between the world's two largest economies. Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said on Thursday that China is prepared to continue fighting. \"Let me stress that tariff wars and trade wars have no winners. China does not want to fight them, but will not fear when they come our way,\" Lin said at a regularly scheduled press conference. Speaking from the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump repeated a previous assertion that China would eventually negotiate with the U.S. \"President Xi's a very smart guy and I think we'll end up making a very good deal,\" he said. The president added that he didn't think the U.S. would need to further increase tariffs to bring Beijing to the bargaining table. \"I can't imagine it,\" he said. China has signaled it is willing to negotiate, but only if the U.S. administration changes its attitude. \"If the U.S. really wants to talk, it should show an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" Lin, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Thursday. Meanwhile, several other Asian economies breathed a sigh of relief and welcomed more time to negotiate trade deals and avoid steeper tariffs. Nonetheless, a baseline tariff of 10% will remain in place for all countries during the 90-day suspension of higher tariffs that particularly targeted Asian manufacturing hubs, like Vietnam and Cambodia. \"Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss in more detail the economic and trade cooperation between Taiwan and the United States,\" said Lin Chia-lung, Taiwan's foreign minister. The island state sells billions of dollars worth of data servers and semiconductors to U.S. tech companies, though the latter were excluded from the most recent round of tariffs. Lin added that Taiwan is committed to buying more American goods and increasing investments in the U.S. Taiwan had been facing a 32% tariff hit on its exports to the U.S., before Trump announced his temporary reprieve. South Korea's top trade envoy, Cheong In-kyo, also said Thursday that the tariff suspension provides room for negotiations, according to Reuters. Cheong had flown to Washington to discuss with U.S. trade officials reducing tariff rates and nontariff trade barriers between the two countries. Japan and the United States are also due to begin trade talks soon. Ashish Valentine contributed to this report.",

    "full_content": "Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.  By Karen Freifeld (Reuters) -Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing could face a penalty of $1 billion or more to settle a U.S. export control investigation over a chip it made that ended up inside a Huawei AI processor, according to two people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Commerce has been investigating the world's biggest contract chipmaker's work for China-based Sophgo, the sources said. The design company's TSMC-made chip matched one found in Huawei's high-end Ascend 910B artificial intelligence processor, according to the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Huawei - a company at the center of China's AI chip ambitions that has been accused of sanctions busting and trade secret theft - is on a U.S. trade list that restricts it from receiving goods made with U.S. technology. TSMC made nearly three million chips in recent years that matched the design ordered by Sophgo and likely ended up with Huawei, according to Lennart Heim, a researcher at RAND's Technology and Security and Policy Center in Arlington, Virginia, who is tracking Chinese developments in AI. The $1 billion-plus potential penalty comes from export control regulations allowing for a fine of up to twice the value of transactions that violate the rules, the sources said. Because TSMC's chipmaking equipment includes U.S. technology, the company's Taiwan factories are within reach of U.S. export controls that prevent it from making chips for Huawei, or producing certain advanced chips for any customer in China without a U.S. license. Heim said that based on the design, which is for AI applications, TSMC should not have made the chip for a company headquartered in China, especially given the risk that it could be diverted to a restricted entity like Huawei. Shares of TSMC traded in the U.S. erased a nearly 3% gain to trade slightly lower after the news. Penalizing TSMC comes at a critical moment for U.S.-Taiwan relations as the two begin re-negotiating their trading relationship after Trump last week slapped a 32% levy on imports from Taipei. The tariffs exclude chips, but Trump has said his team is looking at levies on semiconductors. In March, TSMC said at the White House that it plans to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that includes building five additional chip facilities in coming years. Reuters could not determine how the Trump administration will proceed with TSMC or when the matter would be resolved. Top officials have said they plan to seek higher penalties for export violations. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined comment. TSMC spokesperson Nina Kao said in a statement that the company is committed to complying with the law. She added that TSMC has not supplied to Huawei since mid-September 2020 and that they are cooperating with the Commerce Department. Speaking to reporters in Taipei on Wednesday, Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said TSMC is a company that respects laws and regulations, but his ministry has not received any notification about a possible fine and he could not comment further. No public action has been taken against TSMC. But typically, Commerce issues a \"proposed charging letter\" to a company it believes has engaged in prohibited conduct. The letter usually cites the dates alleged violations took place, the value, and the formula for a civil penalty, and it gives the company 30 days to respond. MORE ENFORCEMENT At a conference in Washington last month, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke about the role of export control enforcement in addressing the threat from China. \"We are going to seek in this administration a dramatic increase in enforcement and fines for people who break the rules,\" Lutnick said. \"We have had enough of people trying to make a dollar supporting the people who seek to destroy our way of life.\" Jeffrey Kessler, who was confirmed in March as Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security to oversee U.S. export controls, was more targeted at his Feb. 27 nomination hearing, saying that reports of TSMC chips going to Huawei was \"a huge concern\" and that \"strong enforcement\" was critical. A 10-figure fine for export control violations would be rare. In 2023, BIS imposed a $300 million penalty on Seagate Technology Holdings as part of a settlement over its shipping over $1.1 billion worth of hard disk drives to Huawei, as first reported by Reuters. TSMC first came under scrutiny last fall. TechInsights, a Canadian tech research firm, took apart a Huawei 910B AI accelerator and found a TSMC die, as it's also called, in the multi-chip system. After the TechInsights finding, TSMC suspended shipments to Sophgo and, in November, as Reuters reported, the Commerce Department ordered the chipmaker to halt shipments to China of seven-nanometer or more advanced chips that could be used in AI applications. In January, Sophgo, which in October denied any business relationship with Huawei, was placed on the same Commerce department restricted trade list as Huawei. Sophgo could not be reached for comment. Huawei's Ascend 910B has been viewed as the most advanced mass-produced AI chip available from a Chinese company, providing an alternative to California-based industry leader Nvidia.

    "full_content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n \n            A fossilized jawbone dredged up by a fishing net from the seafloor 15 ½ miles (25 kilometers) off the coast of Taiwan in 2010 looked human, but for years scientists failed to nail down exactly where it fit in the human family tree.\n     \n            Now, scientists have been able to confirm the identity of the mystery fossil, known as Penghu 1, through analyzing ancient protein fragments contained in teeth still attached to the jaw. The jawbone belonged to a Denisovan man, according to the findings published   Thursday in the journal Science.\n     \n            “We’ve determined and shown over the past couple of years that these proteins can survive longer than DNA does, and that if we have decent recovery, we can say something about the evolutionary ancestry of a specimen,” said study coauthor Frido Welker, an associate professor of biomolecular paleoanthropology at the University of Copenhagen’s Globe Institute in Denmark.\n     \n            Fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan long have dredged up the bones of ancient animals — elephants, water buffalo and hyenas — in their nets, relics of an ice age past when sea levels were lower and the ocean channel was a land bridge.\n     \n            The Denisovan man likely lived on this strip of land that once existed between what’s now China and Taiwan. This discovery establishes the third place that the enigmatic ancient humans first identified in 2010 were definitively known to have lived and shows that the Denisovans occupied a diverse range of environments: Siberian mountains, the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau and the humid subtropical latitudes, Welker added.\n     \n            Fishermen who find fossils among their catch often sell their finds to antique shops, where collectors pick them up, said study coauthor Chun-Hsiang Chang, a curator of paleontology at Taiwan’s National Museum of Natural Science. The museum has thousands of fossils found from the seabed in its collection.\n     \n            One collector brought the jawbone, now identified as Denisovan,   to the museum wanting to know more about the specimen, and Chang said he immediately realized it was unusual and encouraged the collector to donate or sell the fossil to the museum, which he did.\n     \n            A paper Chang coauthored in 2015 argued the fossil belonged to the genus Homo, the grouping to which our species, Homo sapiens, and other ancient humans such as Neanderthals belong, but colleagues   were  not able to extract any ancient DNA from the fossil and couldn’t verify the exact species.\n     \nRelated article\nPuzzling fossils unearthed in China may rewrite the human story\n \n            It also wasn’t possible to date the fossil accurately. Scientists believe it has an age range of between 10,000 and 70,000 or 130,000 and 190,000 years old, dating the bone to a time when past sea levels in that vicinity  were low.\n     \n            Chang took the specimen to Copenhagen in 2022 hoping to learn more from Welker and other scientists who were pioneering techniques to extract proteins from fossils, a field known as paleoproteomics.\n     \n            Chang recalled airport security in Copenhagen stopping him when the case containing the jawbone passed through an X-ray machine.  “They stopped me and wanted me to open (the case),” he said. “I thought maybe they were going to arrest me.” Chang said he was allowed to leave only after sharing his credentials and giving the security personnel “a very short human evolution lesson.”\n     \n            Before testing the jawbone, Welker and his colleagues sampled an elephant bone and pig bone   from the same part of the seabed to work out which extraction methods would work best and determine whether proteins were still present. The team found proteins and proceeded with extracting them.\n \n            Two amino acid sequences from the proteins recovered from the specimen matched those known from the Denisovan genome — a complete set of genetic information sequenced from DNA. What’s more, the lab work detected a type of protein with a sex-specific peptide called amelogenin, and Y-chromosome specific peptides revealed that the Denisovan individual was male, Welker said.\n     \n            Denisovans were first identified in 2010 in a lab using DNA sequences extracted from a tiny fragment of finger bone found in Denisova Cave in Siberia’s Altai Mountains, which is how the group got its name.\n     \n            Genetic analysis subsequently revealed that the Denisovans, like Neanderthals, had once interbred with early modern humans. Traces of Denisovan DNA found in present-day people suggest the ancient species likely once lived across much of Asia, and the recent discovery of Denisovan fossils from outside their namesake cave has begun to show they occupied a wide range of places in Asia.\n     \nRelated article\nDenisovans were living on the Tibetan plateau surprisingly recently, scientists say\n \n            In 2019, scientists shared news that a jawbone found in a cave on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, known as the Xiahe mandible, contained a Denisovan molecular signature. A Denisovan rib bone from the same cave was reported in 2024.\n     \n            In 2022, scientists identified a tooth unearthed at a cave in Laos as Denisovan because it closely resembled the tooth from the Xiahe mandible. The clue placed the species in Southeast Asia for the first time, though scientists were not able to get any definitive molecular information from the molar to confirm it.\n     \n            The good preservation of the proteins in the Penghu 1 mandible is surprising, given that it had been at the bottom of the sea for a long time, said archaeologist Zhang Dongju, a professor at China’s Lanzhou University who worked on the Xiahe jawbone. She was not involved in the study.\n     \n            “With the accumulation of Denisovan fossils and the increase of Denisovan-specific molecular signature identified, identification of Denisovan fossils will be easier,” she said.  “And I believe more Denisovan fossils will be found and identified in (the) future. And we will know more about this mysterious species.”\n     \n            Katerina Douka, an associate professor in archaeological science at Austria’s University of Vienna, described Denisovans as a paradox because scientists have detailed genetic information about the species but few fossils, so little is known about how they looked, although she noted they had “exceptionally large” molars.\n     \n            The Penghu 1 and Xiahe mandibles did not have wisdom teeth, which could indicate that their jaws did not protrude forward in their face, said Ryan McRae, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.\n     \n            “Neither mandible has a chin, like modern humans do, so the front of their jawline would probably look flatter than ours,” McRae said by email. “The authors wisely point out that the Penghu mandible is male, which means that it may exhibit the larger, more robust end of variation for this species. In other words, female Denisovans could look the same, or quite different, we just don’t know yet.”\n     \n            Douka and McRae weren’t involved in the study.\n     \n            The mysterious humans don’t have a widely accepted official species name yet, although some scientists have suggested Homo juluensis, a classification that groups  Denisovan fossils with other fossils from China, including “dragon man,” a skull described in 2021. \n \n            Chang said that he and his colleagues hope to revisit the 4,000 or so fossils in the National Museum of Natural Science’s collection that have been gathered from the seabed in the Taiwan Strait over the past 40 to 50 years and use the same proteomic methods applied to the Penghu 1 jawbone to investigate whether any other fragments belong to Denisovans.\n     \n            “Maybe inside my collection there’s some treasure we don’t know about,” Chang said.",

    "full_content": "President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he threatened Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company with a \"big tax\" of up to 100% if the chipmaker didn't build its plants in America. Trump was speaking at a dinner event organized by the National Republican Congressional Committee when he criticized the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022. \"These chip companies are loaded. They give these companies billions of dollars to build a plant in the United States. They don't build them in the US,\" Trump said Tuesday. The Biden administration said in November that it had awarded TSMC up to $6.6 billion in funding to build three chip factories in Phoenix. TSMC's first factory in Phoenix faced construction delays initially but started producing chips last year. Last month, TSMC said it would invest $100 billion to build five new chip factories in the US. The company said the investment was on top of the $65 billion it announced in April 2024. Trump said on Tuesday that he'd convinced TSMC to deepen its manufacturing footprint in the US without offering more funding. \"All I did is say, 'If you don't build your plant here, you are going to pay a big tax. Twenty-five, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100%,'\" Trump said. TSMC declined to comment when approached by Business Insider. Trump has threatened companies with tariffs in the past. While on the campaign trail in September, Trump said he'd impose a 200% tariff on John Deere if the agriculture equipment company moved its manufacturing to Mexico. Last week, Trump announced a slate of reciprocal tariffs on more than 180 countries. The tariffs, which start at a baseline rate of 10%, took effect on Wednesday. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Thursday that while the tariffs didn't apply to semiconductors, Trump was still thinking about how he could restore the US's foothold in chip making. \"Donald Trump's going to deeply study those. And those are going to come later on how to reshore from Taiwan all that semiconductor manufacturing,\" Lutnick said. \"We have to protect ourselves at some point. America has to be able to protect itself.\" Representatives for the White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",

    "full_content": "A Naples landmark has received a top honor for one its most popular and unique attractions. The Naples Zoo has been named in USA Today's 10Best Readers' Choice Awards for 2025. The national news publication rated the Naples Zoo's Primate Expedition Cruise eighth among the 10 best zoo exhibits across the country for 2025.  \"The best zoo exhibits not only educate but also engage visitors by transporting them to another place, whether it be the foothills of the Himalayas, a Florida swamp, or to an island in Madagascar,\" USA Today said in announcing the winners. \"But which zoo exhibits are the most impressive, immersive, and informative in the country?\" USA Today asked a panel of experts to nominate their top picks, then readers voted to determine the winners. The Naples Daily News is part of Gannett, which publishes USA TODAY and more than 200 local news sites nationwide. The Naples Zoo exhibit was one of two in Florida that were recognized. \"The Primate Expedition Cruise is a unique opportunity only found at Naples Zoo where visitors climb aboard a catamaran for a 15- to 20-minute cruise around islands where monkeys, gibbons, and lemurs cavort in their own tropical paradise,\" USA Today's 10Best said. \"This unique lake habitat contains multiple primate-friendly islets complete with climbing structures, hammocks, and fruit trees. The cruise's design maintains primates' privacy and visibility simultaneously — they can retreat into foliage or venture closer to passing boats. These naturalist-guided tours share insights about each species' adaptations and social structures, while the boat's design ensures every seat is prime viewing real estate.\" In the past year, Naples Zoo officials said, it welcomed more than 425,000 visitors, with more than 285,000 embarking on a Primate Expedition Cruise. Top 5 things to do this weekend: Free concert, Earth Day, Celebrate Bonita! Officially known as Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens, it opened in 1969 and sits on 43 acres and in 2019 celebrated 100 years as a botanical garden and 50 years as a zoo. The primate cruise opened in 1992, and through the years, has remained perhaps the most popular attraction because it offers a respite from the heat while people can observe fascinating animals.

    "full_content": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has lodged a protest with China about a statement that misquoted Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's remarks during Friday's meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Japan's top government spokesperson said on Monday. An announcement by China's foreign ministry on Friday said Ishiba had said Japan \"respects\" the positions of the Chinese side, as detailed by Wang during the meeting. Wang stressed Japan should \"fulfil important political commitments on historical issues and the Taiwan question,\" and that Tokyo should send \"the right signal to the world with a responsible attitude towards history, the people and the future,\" according to China's statement on the meeting. But Japan's foreign ministry said on Saturday that \"no such statement was ever made,\" and asked China to delete the incorrect material. \"We've protested to the Chinese side and immediately requested the removal of the announcement, stating that it was not factual,\" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a press conference. He did not disclose the details, including the Chinese response, but said \"it is regrettable that the non-factual announcement was issued\". During the meeting, Ishiba stressed the necessity of reducing concerns and issues between the two nations, including the situation in the East China Sea, early release of Japanese nationals detained in China and lifting import restrictions on Japan's marine and agricultural products, Japan's foreign ministry said. China's foreign ministry said on Monday the meeting between Wang and Ishiba was \"important and beneficial\" and \"embodied the spirit of mutual respect\". \"Isn't it normal to respect each other's positions in state-to-state relations?\" ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in response to a question about Japan's protest. On Monday afternoon, the statement on China's foreign ministry website still included the Ishiba remarks Japan had requested removed.

    "full_content": "President Trump’s sweeping global tariffs have rocked the stock market since being announced on Tuesday, with just about every major tech company down double-digits. Semiconductors were largely spared from an immediate impact, however, as chips from Taiwan and other nations were exempted. Most electronics sold in the United States are powered by chips made in Asia, meaning tariffs would have a significant impact on prices. But Trump told a White House press pool on Thursday that tariffs on semiconductors will be imposed “very soon.” Already, tariffs on foreign-made goods have led Nintendo to announce a delay in U.S. pre-orders for the Switch 2 while it assesses the potential impact of tariffs. And Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later startup made a meme for letting customers pay for food deliveries in installments, delayed its planned IPO on Friday. Global economic uncertainty probably hurts the business case for financing Chipotle burritos through zero-interest, unsecured loans. President Trump had already threatened to impose large tariffs on semiconductors made abroad as the United States aims to build more crucial technology domestically. China’s closure of Shanghai in 2022 over a COVID-19 outbreak highlighted the risk of relying on long, international supply chains for essential manufacturing. TSMC, one of the major chipmakers that makes products for the likes of Nvidia and Apple, has committed more than $100 billion to open production and R&D facilities in the United States, but scaling takes a long time. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimated it would take Apple three years and $20 billion to move ten percent of manufacturing to the U.S. If President Trump is trying to make the United States more competitive in manufacturing, it makes some sense to include chips in tariffs. Domestic manufacturers like Intel rely on foreign-made hardware to build their chips locally, and with tariffs in place, that hardware will cost more, subsequently meaning the chips themselves will not be competitive to those built abroad. Tom’s Hardware detailed how prices of chips could increase under new tariffs: For example, if there is a 25% tariff on an Nvidia AI GPU that the company sells for $50,000 with a 75% gross margin, then Nvidia will have to declare a value of $12,500 and pay an import duty of $3,125. Such a tariff will either hurt Nvidia’s margins or make its GPUs more expensive for buyers in America. For Elon Musk’s next-generation data centers, which are set to contain a million GPUs, this means $3.125 billion of additional costs. President Trump has said that the tariffs imposed on Wednesday are meant to create a level playing field for manufacturing. And while it makes sense to move some manufacturing back to the United States, doing so takes many years. Products made domestically will still surely be more expensive than alternatives made abroad. Labor in the United States is expensive, and worker protections and regulations add to that burden. America has long been a service economy; people in the U.S. do not want to do hard labor. Certain sectors like chipmaking may be viable to reshore to the United States as they are higher margin businesses than commodity goods like toasters or shoes. But it is unclear whether physical products made in the United States would ever be competitive globally, and manufacturers would still need to import rare earth metals that are not found in U.S. soil. The largest economy in the world is adept at services—designing products, writing code—and leaving the elbow work to other countries. Even if manufacturing of durable goods does come back to America, there is a widespread belief that much of it will be automated, such as with Tesla’s Optimus robot. Amazon has continued to invest heavily in automating its factories. Under tariffs one could envision Americans paying more for lower-quality goods, especially making the new tax regressive to low-income Americans. And for businesses, they could make U.S. companies less competitive because their costs of doing business will be higher. And this is at a time when China is racing ahead in fields like AI and automotive. Many economists believe that a budget deficit, which the U.S. currently faces, means the country spends more importing goods than it does exporting. But there are other ways to balance the books that would not harm Americans in the process, like negotiating down drug prices. Tariff differences similarly could be ameliorated without creating enemies. All countries support their domestic industries to some extent, such as by subsidizing agriculture. Some middle ground could theoretically be achieved. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell said on Friday that Trump’s tariffs will likely stoke “higher inflation and slower growth,” and warned that unemployment could rise after several months of strength. But he added that the Federal Reserve is not going to immediately lower interest rates, which could dampen the impact. Which is to say, Powell does not plan on bailing out Trump despite widespread criticism of the tariffs amongst the business community. \nNvidiaPoliticspresident trumpTariffsTSMC  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          It's the Art of the Deal.\n         \n          Tesla's factory in Shanghai only produces the carmaker's more affordable models, with the Model S and X imported from the U.S.\n         \n          On again, off again.\n         \n          As the Trump administration continues to play hardball with China, American businesses are raising their prices.\n         \n          The China Film Administration said it would moderately reduce the amount of US imports that make it to the country's theaters.\n         \n          A planned export restriction was reportedly cancelled after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million per-head dinner at Mar-a-Lago.",

    "full_content": "All your favorite tech is soon going to hit the wall of tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. Already, the tariffs are forcing Nintendo to revise its Switch 2 preorder timeline, potentially making an expensive $450 handheld console even more expensive. If you want to buy a new laptop, phone, light, or practically any electronic, you should do it now, or else hold off buying anything new until the next hair-brained scheme snails its way from the Trump White House. Trump’s White House implemented its tariff scheme on Wednesday, but “Liberation Day,” as the president called it, was met by confusion from the get-go. Eventually, reporters managed to confirm a 10% on practically every country or landmass the world over, including the uninhabited Heard and McDonald islands. The tariffs, epitomized by a 54% tariff on Chinese goods, are based on an obtuse mathematical formula that doesn’t make a lot of sense but does make gadgets a lot pricier. Other neighboring countries like Vietnam (46% tariff), Cambodia (49%), and Taiwan (32%) were some of the hardest hit by Trump’s decree. Unfortunately these are some of the countries that tech companies rely on most for manufacturing. Big tech firms invested heavily in Vietnamese manufacturing since the trade war between the U.S. and China started heating up last time Trump was in office. U.S. Census Bureau data shows the country counts as the sixth top source for imported goods to the U.S. Tech firms both big and small each have to determine how much of the cost they need to pass onto the consumer versus how much of the difference they want to eat themselves. Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told The Verge companies are going to be incentivized to lay “a good share” of the cost of tariffs onto downstream consumers. The only saving grace is that consumers have a small, shrinking window when they can buy some electronics before the price increases start in earnest. Miller told The Verge that companies have imported 70% more products into the U.S. over the past few months than in the same time in 2023. So for now, you may still find all your tech at the pre-tariff price. But don’t expect the current prices to last. It’s better to assume companies will raise prices sooner rather than later. In February, major PC and device maker Acer announced it was raising prices by around 10% due to tariffs. It’s only a matter of time before they go even higher. If you want another scary example of how tech could get much more expensive in the months ahead, look at Apple. Apple relies on Vietnam for much of its manufacturing. A report from Reuters based on industry analyst predictions proposed a $1,142 price tag for the iPhone 17 under these new tariffs. That’s close to $350 more expensive than an $800 iPhone 16. The highest-end iPhone Pro Max with max 1 TB storage might cost close to $2,300 using the same math. The Cheeto-in-chief suggested on Friday he could impose tariffs specifically targeting semiconductors “very soon.” This would take already expensive tech and make it untenable for most consumers in the U.S. The idea is these tariffs are supposed to bring manfucaturing back to the U.S, but it won’t happen overnight. It takes time to build up the manufacturing apparatus, especially something as complicated as chips. Intel is set to receive $7.9 billion from the U.S. through the CHIPS act enacted under the tenure of President Joe Biden. The company was building an Ohio chip foundry, but that project has been delayed to an expected opening date of 2030. Trump recently pushed an executive order that would punish companies by withholding CHIPS funding if they didn’t invest in U.S. manufacturing. So yes, your phones, tablets, and laptops with all their silicon could get way, way more expensive if Trump follows through on additional tariffs, but that’s not all. As noted by CNN, modern cars rely on more than 1,000 semiconductor chips with some having over 3,000. There’s no upside here. The tariffs are already incentivizing layoffs at companies like Stellantis. So while economic uncertainty may be pushing you to hold off on any spending sprees, wouldn’t you rather be unemployed with a Steam Deck than without a Steam Deck? \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.",

    "full_content": "Apple and its customers can breathe a sigh of relief today after the White House carved tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, and more. The iPhone maker was facing a 145% fee on products imported into the United States from China. This caused weeks of speculation that the iPhone and other electronics could be subject to price hikes to cover the cost. Bloomberg reported on the tariff exemption policy development: The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump’s 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries. The exclusions would apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years. The products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers. The move follows a week of policy and market volatility in which the White House issued tariff increases across the board for imports, reset tariff rates for 90 days for most countries except for China, and stated that the iPhone could be built in the USA. But as Bloomberg’s coverage suggests, the tech industry may not be out of the woods yet. That’s because the Trump administration may be planning sector-specific tariff rates separate from the 145% tariff rate put on imports from China. For now, the return to a 10% tariff rate on electronics will likely offer relief to Apple and consumers who were rushing to buy products at pre-tariff prices over the last few days.

    "full_content": "Earlier this week I wrote an article called “A US-Made iPhone Is Pure Fantasy.\" The long and short of it is that Trump’s dream of moving all high tech manufacturing to the US is extremely difficult because global supply chains are so intricate, manufacturing expertise exists primarily in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and other countries, and the components that go into a phone are often made in other countries as well. But there is currently one smartphone that qualifies for a “Made in the USA” title from the FTC. It’s the Liberty Phone, which is made by a company called Purism. The phone is a version of Purism’s Librem 5. The Made-in-China Librem 5 costs $800, and the Liberty phone costs $2,000. It has 4 GB of memory, and reviewers say that its specs are pretty outdated. Not every single component in the Liberty Phone is made in the USA, but the company has been trying very hard to make it as American-made as possible. The fact that it exists at all is kind of a miracle, and the way that Purism is approaching manufacturing is really interesting, so I called Purism’s founder, Todd Weaver, to talk about smartphone supply chains, making tech products in the United States, and tariffs. Here’s our discussion, which has been edited for length and clarity. The full, hour-long discussion is available here as a bonus episode of the 404 Media podcast:  404 Media: What you're doing is super interesting and I know you've been doing it for a while. I know that there's been tons of discussion over the last few weeks about bringing manufacturing back to the United States, the difficulty of doing that with different supply chains and components and things like that. And I know to the best of your ability, you've brought the Liberty Phone to the U.S. Can you tell me a little bit about what the Liberty Phone is and how long you've been doing it for?  Todd Weaver: So the first thing is I started the company, Purism, in 2014. The original business plan is actually what we were able to execute on over the course of the last 10 years, and looking at doing a fair number of things different than is currently done. One of those is US manufacturing for a lot of reasons, secure supply chain, where we get to manage all the components, full transparency, I can also release my schematics. And then that gets us to where we're really targeting that security market as well, because the security market needs to have control and also verify the claims of any technology stack being used. When I started the company, we also did laptops. And then I knew I wanted to get to the point of phones. But I also knew that I had to increment my way there by building laptops first, showcasing that I'm able to do all of that on the hardware, software services side, and then get to the point of the phone. When we did the phone, it was the Librem 5 phone. After we were successful on the Librem 5 crowdfunding campaign, we took our own electronics engineers (EEs), and then we worked with Chinese design and manufacturing through 2018, 2019, and 2020, because that's where every phone is made. We had to leverage the knowledge base that was offshored into that country to do so. And so at that point, we were able to take our designs and educate our staff on the entire process and produce the Librem 5. And then we were able to take all those designs and spin up our own SMT, it's called Surface Mount Technology, where we can actually produce the entire electronics of the device at our facility, therefore bringing it back to US soil. And so we have a few different SKUs of our product offering that are manufactured in our facility.  We have a varying degree of the country of origin for components or the total product. So on one end of that spectrum, you have our server, which is an Intel reference design manufactured out of China, and then we're importing it. And then you go through the whole scale all the way down to Liberty Phone and our Librem Key that are 100% produced at our facility in Carlsbad, California. On those two products we take the printed circuit board, which is just a blank board that has no components and run that through our surface mount technology by our line operators. And so we go from resistors and capacitors and integrated circuits, put them all on the board, take it off the board, do quality control, any firmware loading. Then we assemble the entire phone and then do a software load for the customer and then ship it direct. That whole process is top to bottom done at our facility. There’s a difference between a phone that is fully made and manufactured in the United States and one that is assembled in the United States. Do you believe that you're manufacturing the phone from start to finish in the United States? There's no question about it. The difference is actually defined by the FTC. So the Federal Trade Commission has language that describes the difference between assembled and manufactured. Assembly is where you are putting parts together. And they actually even have a sub definition of that called screwdriver assembly. So if you only take a screwdriver to it, and that's the only tool you're using, meaning snapping parts and using a screwdriver, then you cannot claim it was ‘made in the USA’ or you can't even claim ‘assembled in the USA.’ When you're looking at the Liberty phone, we are taking the bare board and we are doing the entire manufacturing process of all of the electronics, meaning resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits are being put onto that board. It's going from raw materials to finished goods at our facility. And then we assemble the entire printed circuit board into the actual chassis of the phone. And then we also load our own operating system and then ship it to the customer. So, not only are we doing full electronics manufacturing at our facility on US soil, but we're also doing the entire operating system and authorship and releasing of that.  You're not buying components from overseas and then screwing them together here? You're making the components here as well? Components are the things that you're actually purchasing like a resistor and a capacitor and integrated circuit. Those we are buying from a Western distributor and each chip set that you use has a country of origin. In our case, we also use chip sets that are like ST Micro [a Swiss company with American factories], Texas instruments. These are manufactured on US soil. So we also go down as deep as we possibly can to purchase from US or Westernized distribution or manufacturers of those components and chips. So obviously resistors, capacitors are manufactured on US oil. We purchase those and install them. When you're talking about the PCB, which is the blank board and the PCBA, which is the printed circuit board assembly. You're taking those raw components and you're putting them onto a board, meaning soldering them onto a board, and then you have a finished electronic circuit board. When you're talking about other companies, what they're importing is typically finished goods, finished electronics. Meaning the chassis, the battery, the whole entire electronics inside. And in rare cases, they might import just the motherboard, meaning the printed circuit board or PCBA assembly. We're very unique in the sense that we actually go from parts in stock all the way to the manufacturing process, all the way to finished goods at our facility. It is a vertically integrated manufacturing process. And that is, as you can recognize, extremely rare. The last part of this is the raw materials, the minerals that are being mined and turned into the different parts that you're sourcing from suppliers. Do you try to work with suppliers who are making parts using materials mined in the US? Or is that too hard to follow that deep into the supply chain? Yes, we do, but there's levels of complexity, as you can imagine, where the desire is there, but sometimes the parts aren't, or sometimes the negotiation with the suppliers turn into much more challenging or time consuming for the scale that we happen to be at. And then there's another bit of that, which also is leverage. If you're talking millions of units, as a manufacturer you have a lot more leverage than if you have a hundred thousand or tens of thousands. And so there is a degree of how hard can you push into the supply chain for contractual sourcing of raw materials, meaning mined materials. What we tend to do when we're doing Liberty phone is use Western distribution which has to comply with an awful lot more regulation on where it can source components from.  Our philosophy from the very early days, especially as it relates to US manufacturing, is we go as deep as we possibly can to releasing our schematics, to sourcing our components, to having our HBOM, it's called a hardware bill of materials, a country of origin available, to the transparency of all of our source code that we author being published as well so you can verify that all of our claims are accurate. How long did it take you to implement this vision for manufacturing everything in the United States?  2017 was when we actually began to say ‘We want to manufacture a phone and we would like to do it on US soil.’ We then actually manufactured our Librem Key as a very small security token at the same facility, same US soil manufacturing process. But it was a much easier product to produce, but that also showed, hey, we're able to do it on a simpler product.  Then in 2019, we were able to get what's called PVT samples. That's where you sort of get the initial versions of hardware being produced. So that two years is really about design changes that we needed, developing every bit out. But also in parallel to that, we were educating our electronic engineers to say, every time we're sourcing a Chinese resistor [a circuit board component], let's make sure we're getting the same resistance on a US resistor. We always were sort of maintaining two different bills of materials of Chinese componentry and Western componentry because they're different. Then we produced five different iterations of the Librem 5 phone through Chinese contract manufacturing. And we iterated through those five changes over the course of about 18 months. At that point, we finally had a production ready product. And then we were able to take everything that we did and bring it to US soil.  [The Librem 5 USA was released in 2020, after three years of development.] Imagine this literally starting from scratch, you're looking at probably a three year cycle from, from ‘Let's take an existing made-in-China product and then just produce the same thing in the US.’  Were there specific components or specific parts of the phone that were harder to source in the United States or harder to manufacture in the United States because we don't make that type of component in the US or there's not a US supplier that sells it? Yes. There's US-manufactured, and then there’s ‘Westernized’ sourcing, so something from Germany or Europe or Canada. There's a bunch of these where you can’t get a US-component but you can get a ‘Western’ component. And then there’s things you can’t get [from a Western manufacturer]. One specific item is a type of crystal that needs to be put into phones, which is basically for keeping track of time and a few other measurement metrics. That crystal is something that only comes from China, and maybe I think you can get it from South Korea, which is where we either are sourcing or trying to source that last component from. Even where we care to do 100 percent of it, there's still always something that you can try and dig one level deeper and you realize, that's a mineral or a mineral resource of something that's coming from somewhere that would be outside of the U.S. So then you need to import it and you wonder, ‘Is that ever going to be produced in the US or is there some company who would like to begin doing so?’ It's obviously a very complex question when you're dealing with, you know, in our case, 200 unique parts and the entire sourcing of all of them. You can imagine the majority of companies who are just selling electronics from manufacturers somewhere else, they don't care. There's no transparency, no visibility, and the company itself doesn't even know the designs or what goes into it. Your table of component origins on the Liberty Phone site shows where things come from. Most of it is USA, but then you have the M2 Modem module that says its origin declaration is China. Is there a specific reason that’s not USA?  The M2 module, we actually have options for US made and then we also have European, Germany. That module, specifically for cellular, it depends on the bands that you're looking to install it at or in some cases cost, right? So we have that as an actual module that you can snap in. The one that we ship for when we sell the [Chinese-made] Librem 5 is a Chinese modem. But we have a US-made one and a few other westernized countries for that modem module. We have the options of different bands, different country of origin, and to be able to put that in after the fact or during final assembly. But I would just imagine that the Chinese one is a lot cheaper. Yeah, absolutely. It's cheaper, it also has pretty wide bands.  The phone that you were able to manufacture in the United States is not as fast as the latest iPhone. Can the newest best chips and components be manufactured in the US, and what would it take to do it here? The short answer is yes, I do, because you didn't ask me the timing. It's going to be multiples of years and a major investment and undertaking. And it has to show that there's a ROI and that there’s stability, like ‘This is the future that we’re going to live in, so let’s actually invest in doing all those things.’ When you're talking chipsets, the actual CPUs inside of Apple and Samsung and Google phones, those are a complete computer where it's hardware, the CPU, memory, and baseband modem, the cellular modem all combined onto one. And typically that's from Qualcomm or MediaTek. And those particular chipsets are produced outside of China. So really what you're referring to is the actual design of a finished good saying, take the semiconductor and put it into a phone and then add all the other components, the 200 and some other unique components into the finished good. And that is done in China specifically for Apple and a bunch of other major manufacturers. It's obviously far more complex, but to try and just level set a little bit about that, where you're at now is you say ‘Let's take what we have in China and try to replicate that in the U.S.’ Well, the challenge is that all high tech jobs were put into China. You have a brain transfer where the ODMs, the original design manufacturers, are in China. If you scoured the United States, you would be able to probably actually still count the number of skilled electronics engineers. If you go to Shenzhen, there's floor after floor after floor after floor of skilled EE's.  These are people who design the actual board that goes into devices. That training takes time and effort and energy to get to the point where you can design new devices.  Then you have the next step, which is the actual assembly process. When you're looking at costing, machine versus machine, it's the same price to produce a product in US or China. Because the machine is doing the effort.  But then you have a person who physically grabs the board and does the assembly, which is a much more costly endeavor in the US than it is in China. China can solve problems by throwing people at it. The US and Western countries can solve problems by throwing engineering at it. If you were to go to Dongguan, China, and you see a manufacturing line, they're going to have rows and rows and rows of people who are taking a tablet or a phone that passes by them, and they just do [quality assurance on] pinch to zoom. They have gloves and they touch the screen, drag it open and drag it back and then it moves on the line. If one doesn't do pinch to zoom properly, they send it back. And that is a job for an entire row of people.  But what we did at Purism is we solved it with engineering. How we do that is we actually plug in the phone and we flash the entire device and we run through what we call auto Quality Assurance. And that is where we actually hack the firmware to receive or fake to receive a touch screen event into the firmware itself on the screen. And then we actually replicate a pinch to zoom, take a picture and then back again and take another picture. And as long as those pictures match, we have a functioning touch interface, where we didn't have to have people doing that task.  You can look at our concrete numbers. We sell a Chinese made Librem 5 phone for $799. We sell the Liberty phone for $2,000. When you're looking at just those numbers alone, that looks like a giant leap in cost. But there's a couple of factors that are not publicly known when you're looking at just those prices. When you're looking at COGS, cost of goods sold, our Librem 5 phone is equivalent in cost to about an iPhone. It's about $500 and some odd dollars, $550. So we can see that the Librem 5 phone doesn't have a very high margin when we sell it. The Liberty phone, same COGS componentry wise, but to produce it on US soil, we're adding not quite a hundred dollars. So it's about $650 to produce that entire phone. But what we're doing by selling it for greater originally, we're looking at a lot of differentiators for us. It wasn't just made in the USA. It's the fact that it's a secure supply chain, that you know, staff that's completely auditing every component, which means we're selling to a government security market with all those additional layers that we've added on top. Do you feel like you are in a better spot tariffs-wise than a company that is doing all of their manufacturing in China because you've done all of this? Absolutely, without question. If there’s a vertically integrated company where they have engineers, they have designers, they have the knowledge to be able to do it, then those companies will be able to adapt and bring it forth. If they choose to do US manufacturing, they have at least the ability to. Whereas a company that is marketing and finance, and that's really the bulk of what they're doing, and they don't have any engineering, and they've offloaded all of those tasks. If they have no R&D budget, and they have no operating expenses for any type of engineering or manufacturing, then they're gonna be in a very difficult position because you can also imagine there's kind of a run on the bank, right? Everybody is going to be looking for a company who can build their product at the same time. They have no knowledge of how to do it because that entire process has been brought into China. In China, you’re basically talking to a project manager, who's finding all of the right parties that does all the other tasks, and then they bring in all the engineers and everything else that's needed operationally and what you're receiving at the end of the day is something you can drop ship to a customer without ever actually even opening the box. It’s going to be very challenging to find someone in the US who's going to fill that same void at the same time that everybody else is looking to see if they can fill that void. You are doing this manufacturing in Carlsbad, California. Did you find it difficult to find workers who were able to work on a high tech factory line? We did not have difficulty in finding line operators, or what we call ‘skilled labor’ where you're able to solder something or do assembly with tweezers. That type of skilled labor exists, but it’s also in [geographical] pockets. If you're to say ‘Why in the world are you in Carlsbad, California?’ It's because there’s skilled labor there. There's companies here that currently work for government contract manufacturers, so that's where the labor is, that's why it was easy for us to spin up a line there and hire skilled labor from some of the other companies who have trained up those same staff.  Electronics engineers is a rarer position. And that's what I was describing earlier when you scour the nation you'd come up with, you could count the number of skilled electronics engineers on US soil and there's probably a million in Shenzhen alone.  One thing that I worry about or think might be a problem is if you have tons of companies trying to do this all at once, very quickly, what is that going to be like? Are there enough skilled people to do that here? The answer has to be no. There's enough skilled labor to handle the necessary manufacturing that we're currently doing and you know if you increment it slowly then you can probably get there. If you're talking full EEs, that's multi years of education to get to the point of actually being able to do proper designs that actually work.  There's another bit that you sort of hinted at there that I think is important, and I’m going to address it. The reliability of knowing that a tariff is in place and how long it's going to be in place allows a business to make informed decisions. If it was something where you knew that importing from China is going to be a hundred percent tariff for the next 10 years concretely, every business owner would be making decisions based off of that assumption, and the reliability of that assumption is important.  If it's something where ‘Hey, this is what's going to be 100%, but in two months it might not be, and who knows what's going to happen in three years or four years?’ It makes it very hard for a business owner or the board of directors to say ‘It's worth spinning all this up.’  Did you look at bringing manufacturing to the US as a political project for you? Were you interested in the politics of doing this in the United States or was it a matter of differentiating yourselves? There's like probably about 10 items on the list of reasons why we chose to do manufacturing in the US. And obviously one of those is from a civil liberties perspective. So manufacturing high tech componentry in a hostile nation to the United States is not good geopolitical politics, right? Purism as a company, we also care tremendously about civil liberties and the privacy side of things which is to say we manufacture a phone that doesn't spy on you. That's why we manufacture it and also do all the source code. We can't have some nefarious chip put into the supply chain from a hostile country.  So the short answer is not in the short-term political game, but more of the geopolitical game and also understanding security and privacy and sort of how all those things weave together  I think no matter where you are on the political spectrum, you can look at the last two weeks of tariffs, more tariffs, maybe not tariffs, maybe a delay in tariffs, increased Chinese tariffs and agree that this is chaotic. And you mentioned the stability of sort of knowing what the rules are going to be. Does this all stress you out? I do not stress about the SKUs that we are fully making in the US, right? We don't have to worry about it for our US side, because the majority of it will not be affected. But for others [that we make overseas], you can’t project out, right? What is it gonna be in three months? Should we buy components now? What is it gonna be a year from now? Maybe we should stock up on a bunch of other things? Should we buy it today? Then maybe somebody on your procurement team says, ‘Well, maybe we should wait a week, right?’ Because if it's going to change, is it going to change for the better or worse? And you can imagine those little micro example carries forward to everything else that a business has to decide If the tariff from China is 100%, and you know it is going to be 100 % for the next 10 years, you will make a different business decision than if it is, ‘Might be 100%, not sure what's going to be in three months, what's it going to be in a year from now, and what's it going to be in three years from now.’ That uncertainty does not create stable markets. It does not create very accurate business decisions.",

    "full_content": "Two different teams of astronomers have detected oxygen in the most distant known galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0. The discovery, reported in two separate studies, was made possible thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. This record-breaking detection is making astronomers rethink how quickly galaxies formed in the early Universe. Discovered last year, JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant confirmed galaxy ever found: it is so far away, its light took 13.4 billion years to reach us, meaning we see it as it was when the Universe was less than 300 million years old, about 2% of its present age. The new oxygen detection with ALMA, a telescope array in Chile’s Atacama Desert, suggests the galaxy is much more chemically mature than expected. “It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies,” says Sander Schouws, a PhD candidate at Leiden Observatory, the Netherlands, and first author of the Dutch-led study, now accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. “The results show the galaxy has formed very rapidly and is also maturing rapidly, adding to a growing body of evidence that the formation of galaxies happens much faster than was expected.\"  Galaxies usually start their lives full of young stars, which are made mostly of light elements like hydrogen and helium. As stars evolve, they create heavier elements like oxygen, which get dispersed through their host galaxy after they die. Researchers had thought that, at 300 million years old, the Universe was still too young to have galaxies ripe with heavy elements. However, the two ALMA studies indicate JADES-GS-z14-0 has about 10 times more heavy elements than expected. “I was astonished by the unexpected results because they opened a new view on the first phases of galaxy evolution,” says Stefano Carniani, of the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa, Italy, and lead author on the paper now accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. “The evidence that a galaxy is already mature in the infant Universe raises questions about when and how galaxies formed.” The oxygen detection has also allowed astronomers to make their distance measurements to JADES-GS-z14-0 much more accurate. “The ALMA detection offers an extraordinarily precise measurement of the galaxy’s distance down to an uncertainty of just 0.005 percent. This level of precision — analogous to being accurate within 5 cm over a distance of 1 km — helps refine our understanding of distant galaxy properties,” adds Eleonora Parlanti, a PhD student at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and author on the Astronomy & Astrophysics study [1]. “While the galaxy was originally discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, it took ALMA to confirm and precisely determine its enormous distance,” [2] says Associate Professor Rychard Bouwens, a member of the team at Leiden Observatory. “This shows the amazing synergy between ALMA and JWST to reveal the formation and evolution of the first galaxies.” Gergö Popping, an ESO astronomer at the European ALMA Regional Centre who did not take part in the studies, says: \"I was really surprised by this clear detection of oxygen in JADES-GS-z14-0. It suggests galaxies can form more rapidly after the Big Bang than had previously been thought. This result showcases the important role ALMA plays in unraveling the conditions under which the first galaxies in our Universe formed.\" [1] Astronomers use a measurement known as redshift to determine the distance to extremely distant objects. Previous measurements indicated that the galaxy JADES-GS-z-14-0 was at a redshift between about 14.12 and 14.4. With their oxygen detections, both teams have now narrowed this down to a redshift around 14.18.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomy facility, is a partnership of ESO, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) of Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. ALMA is funded by ESO on behalf of its Member States, by NSF in cooperation with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in Taiwan and by NINS in cooperation with the Academia Sinica (AS) in Taiwan and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI). ALMA construction and operations are led by ESO on behalf of its Member States; by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), managed by Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), on behalf of North America; and by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) on behalf of East Asia. The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) provides the unified leadership and management of the construction, commissioning and operation of ALMA.  The European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to discover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground — which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy — and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO’s headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world’s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky” — ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.  \nStefano Carniani\nScuola Normale Superiore\nPisa, Italy\nTel: +39 050 509156\n\nEmail: stefano.carniani@sns.it \nSander Schouws\nLeiden University\nLeiden, The Netherlands\n\n\nEmail: sanderschouws@gmail.com \nEleonora Parlanti\nScuola Normale Superiore\nPisa, Italy\n\n\nEmail: eleonora.parlanti@sns.it \nRychard Bouwens\nLeiden Observatory, University of Leiden\nLeiden, The Netherlands\nTel: +31 71 527 8456\n\nEmail: bouwens@strw.leidenuniv.nl \nJacqueline Hodge\nLeiden Observatory, University of Leiden\nLeiden, The Netherlands\nTel: +31 71 527 8450\n\nEmail: hodge@strw.leidenuniv.nl \nGergö Popping\nEuropean ALMA Regional Centre, European Southern Observatory\n\nTel: +49 89 3200 6247\n\nEmail: gpopping@eso.org \nBárbara Ferreira\nESO Media Manager\nGarching bei München, Germany\nTel: +49 89 3200 6670\nCell: +49 151 241 664 00\nEmail: press@eso.org We use cookies that are essential for accessing our websites and using our services.

    "full_content": "TSMC’s first US chip plant took significantly longer to build and begin production than was forecast, but the company says that future plants will proceed at a significantly faster pace. This will enable US-made chips for somewhat newer Apple devices. But former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is dismissive of the initiative, suggesting that it will be of little help in enabling the US to be a global player in the chip business …  Regular readers will be familiar with the story so far.  Apple first announced its plan for ‘Made in America’ chips back in 2022, with the news hailed as one of the success stories of the US CHIPS Act. The initiative will see a series of TSMC chipmaking plants built in Arizona, with some of the production reserved for Apple chips for older devices. The project has been beset with delays and uncertainties. Mass production at the first plant was due to start last year and was then pushed back to this year. Questions were raised about the promised US jobs, with many employees recruited from Taiwan, and the company even being accused of “anti-American discrimination.” Skepticism was also voiced about the recent announcement of an additional $100B investment. The first TSMC plant is only capable of making larger process chips used in older Apple devices. This includes the A16 chip first developed for the iPhone 14 Pro, which is no longer made, and the base model iPhone 15 models, which are still available from Apple but likely sell in small volumes. If it takes years to bring a new US plant online, that would mean US-made Apple chips would forever be relegated to significantly older devices. However, Nikkei Asia reports that TSMC has promised investors that the sluggish pace seen with the development of its first US plant will not be repeated. While that first plant took five years to build and open, the company says that future US plants will take no more than two. That will see a 3nm plant brought online in 2028, and a 2nm one “before 2030.” The US plants will still lag behind the cutting-edge ones in Taiwan, meaning they will never make chips for the latest Apple products, but will at least close the gap. Given that TSMC’s advanced chipmaking capabilities far outstripped those of US rival Intel, it’s no surprise that the two companies haven’t exactly been best buddies. After Apple made the switch from Intel Macs to Apple Silicon ones, the US chipmaker insisted it could catch up or even win back the business. Even after being forced out of the company for failing to deliver, ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger remains dismissive of TSMC’s US plants. The Financial Times reports him saying it will do little to advance US chipmaking. “If you don’t have R&D in the US, you will not have semiconductor leadership in the US,” Gelsinger said. “All of the R&D work of TSMC is in Taiwan, and they haven’t made any announcements to move that.” Given that TSMC sees its home base in Taiwan as key to protecting the secrecy of its most advanced tech, it’s exceedingly unlikely the company would ever move any significant R&D work to the US.

    "full_content": "Dutch architecture studio MVRDV has introduced its vision for Market Cube, a versatile marketplace made up of stacked volumes in Zhubei, Taiwan. This innovative design by MVRDV reimagines the traditional market square, featuring a tiered structure intended to offer flexibility and adapt to future shifts in market-building typology. “With its stack of open, flexible floors that can adapt to changing demands, the building acts as an urban condenser and is envisaged as the next step in the evolution of the market,” the studio said. “This future-focused vision is reflected in its name: the market square becomes the Market Cube.” Designer: MVRDV \n\n\n\n\n  The Market Cube will span eight floors and cover 18,962 square meters, featuring two levels dedicated to market space and food courts, as well as exhibition areas, a daycare and children’s center, and a rooftop performance venue. Multi-level underground parking will also be included. The building’s design allows each level to be independently opened to the exterior or closed off, enabling some areas to remain accessible at night. Visualizations of the proposal show expansive external terraces that function as walkways on each level, accessed via two sets of escalators encased in translucent panels. On the first floor, a pedestrian bridge will connect over the adjacent road, providing direct access from the nearby park to the food court. The market spaces on the ground and lower levels will extend into the surrounding streets, integrating the building with its urban environment. \n\n\n\n\n  Inside Market Cube, a diverse array of vendors will be accommodated, ranging from traditional market stalls offering local goods and produce to modern kiosks equipped with built-in seating areas for a more relaxed shopping or dining experience. The interiors are thoughtfully designed with spacious, flexible layouts that can be easily adapted to suit “any alternative use imaginable,” ensuring that the space can evolve with changing needs and trends. High ceilings further enhance the sense of openness, allowing for creative installations or temporary exhibits that can transform the space as needed. To facilitate easy navigation throughout the Market Cube, each level will be illuminated with a distinct color scheme, which will add visual interest and also serve as a guide to the building’s various functions. This color-coding system is designed to intuitively communicate the purpose of each area to visitors, enhancing their overall experience. Strategically placed LED screens will provide information and updates, while neon lights contribute a modern, vibrant aesthetic. Together, these elements create an engaging and dynamic environment that reflects the innovative spirit of the Market Cube.

    "full_content": "The duties would still mark a significant escalation of U.S. tariffs. President Donald Trump’s plan for reciprocal tariffs on April 2 is expected to be more targeted and narrower than what the president has vowed in the past, but the plan is still under discussion, sources told ABC News. The fresh round of duties, however, would still mark a significant escalation for the U.S. and its trading partners. In February, Trump ordered federal agencies to look into virtually every U.S. trading partner in evaluating what reciprocal tariff rate to put on them. “April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol’ USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!” Trump’s officials have been signaling a more conciliatory tone in recent interviews. “One of the things we see from markets is they’re expecting ... these really large tariffs on every single country,” Kevin Hassett, Trump’s National Economic Council director, said on Fox News. “I think markets need to change their expectations, because it’s not everybody that cheats us on trade, it’s just a few countries and those countries are going to be seeing some tariffs.” The administration is focused on trading partners who have major trade imbalances with the U.S., the sources said. “It’s 15% of the countries, but it’s a huge amount of our trading volume,” U.S. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent said last week. Last year, according to federal census data, the U.S. had the biggest trade deficits with China, the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and South Africa. Bloomberg previously reported on the altered plans for tariffs. The Trump administration will likely forego sector-specific tariffs on autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors that were also previously planned for April 2, The Wall Street Journal reported. U.S. stocks surged on Monday on the news of narrower tariff plans. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 500 points, or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 jumped 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq increased more than 2%. In recent weeks, Trump's tariffs have roiled markets, stoked recession concerns and heightened worries about inflation. In short order, Trump has paused or reversed some tariffs, casting doubt over his plans and adding to the uncertainty, experts previously told ABC News. The Trump administration earlier this month slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, though the White House soon imposed a one-month delay for some of those tariffs. A fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China a month prior. Tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum on March 12 triggered retaliatory tariffs from Canada and the European Union, adding to countermeasures already initiated by China. Economists widely expect tariffs to increase inflation, since exporters typically pass along a share of the tax to consumers in the form of price hikes. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said Trump’s tariffs are partly to blame for price increases, leveling the criticism minutes after the central bank announced its decision to hold interest rates steady. Even as the Fed left its main policy lever unchanged, the central bank predicted weaker year-end economic growth and higher inflation than it had in a December forecast.

Hawkins If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Smartphone apps that track our driving behavior may be the key to safer road conditions.  The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety just published a study that found that using smartphone apps to monitor driver behavior, and then providing summaries of that behavior via text message or a data dashboard, leads to safer driving.  Researchers borrowed techniques from usage-based insurance (UBI) programs, in which insurance companies use smartphone apps to measure dangerous driving behaviors, like hard braking, sudden acceleration, and speeding. Rather than rely on actuarial data, like driving records and vehicle type, UBI programs use real-time data from app trackers to determine premiums. These are typically opt-in programs, marketed as a way to lower premiums. But if your driving isn’t as safe as you think, it can lead to higher monthly payments.  Most people have an aversion to being tracked in real-time by their insurance company. But the AAA group was able to show that these methods can lead to safer driving — even after the tracking apps are turned off. Participants were told their data was being reviewed as part of a research study, and not being used by insurance companies to lower or raise their rates.  Most people have an aversion to being tracked in real-time by their insurance company. The research team corralled 1,400 participants and split them into four groups: a control group; a standard feedback group, which were given weekly feedback via text on all behaviors monitored; an assigned goal group, which were given weekly text feedback on one behavior; and a chosen goal group, which selected their own behavior on which to receive feedback.  Among the three feedback groups, 13 percent of participants showed a reduction in speeding, 21 percent showed a reduction in hard braking, and 25 percent experienced less rapid acceleration.  Participants also gave their own feedback on tactics for changing their driving behavior: 67.4 percent said they would be persuaded by the potential to earn extra money; 53.9 percent liked weekly feedback via text message; and 45.8 percent preferred a weekly dashboard that provided detailed driving information for the week.  The research team also monitored the groups’ use of smartphones while driving, and were surprised to find that terrible behavior remained mostly unchanged. They theorized that providing baseline safety scores at the start of the study led drivers to believe they were being safer than they actually were — and therefore, less in need for improvement.  13 percent of participants showed a reduction in speeding After the 12-week study, participants were monitored for an additional six weeks without any feedback to determine whether their improved driving would persist. The study found that generally they continued to drive more safely.  “It’s encouraging to see that many individuals stuck with safer habits even after the study,” said Jake Nelson, AAA’s director of traffic safety advocacy, in a statement. “This shows that positive reinforcement, not just punitive measures, can lead to safer driving habits that can save lives.” In 2023, over 40,000 people died in vehicle crashes in the US. AAA says the research results point to the need for innovative approaches to educating people about safer driving behavior.  Most people have an aversion to being tracked while they drive — especially when you consider that most drivers have an overinflated sense of their own behavior. But UBI programs are growing. In 2020, 16 percent of auto insurance shoppers were offered UBI and 12 percent of them enrolled, according to USA Today. In 2024, 15 percent of buyers were offered UBI, but a almost a fifth of them signed up. We already use our phones to monitor a lot of our behavior, including our steps, our sleep, and our eating habits. Why not driving?

    "full_content": "President Donald Trump has dubiously claimed he wants to be the champion of America’s working class, but his new trade policies seem more likely to kill small businesses and put plenty of working men and women out of a job. Indeed, Trump’s tariff policies aren’t just terrifying Wall Street. They’re also freaking out small business owners, as can be seen by a sudden glut of comments on Reddit’s r/smallbusiness subreddit. There, small business owners can be seen fretting over everything from skyrocketing import duties to the increased costs that they will have to pass on to their customers. One apparent business owner who recently ordered aluminum parts from China expressed amazement at the sudden escalation in import fees. User “eopcido” wrote: We have a small business and ordered $3,380 worth of aluminum parts from China. Parts entered USA on 3/31/25. DHL requires $2,483.21 for “import duty” or they will send back the parts 5 days…Can this be right? A commenter explained the newly added costs to the business owner: “You can expect to add 34% to all future orders, with the possibility of an additional 50% increase after this week. This brings the total potential increase to 156.5%.” “In case everyone hasn’t figured it out yet, Trump and Co don’t want us buying anything from China anymore,” another commenter noted. Another Redditor, who said that they own a retail store, explained how the expected import prices could totally upend their business: “We are looking at anywhere from 20%-60%,” they said, apparently referencing price increases. “That will absolutely destroy my business. Im super worried.” Keep in mind, these comments were coming before China added an additional 84 percent tariff on Tuesday night. Background-pickle389, said that their bamboo clothing business would “likely have to close” due to the exponential increase in costs spurred by the tariffs: Does anyone have any American based manufacturers? I’m devastated that all my hard work is going to be pulled out from underneath. I just hit my 10,000 order last week and don’t know what to do now. My shop is too small to absorb the cost of it all, but I know raising prices isn’t feasible since our cost of living is about to go astronomically high. Another user, Coachellahopefull, explained their own predicament with a European import business they’d built up: My uncle owns a pottery studio in Poland, my mom and I have been wholesaling the product here in the US for the last 20 years. We’ve been holding our breath waiting to see what the tariffs were going to be. It looks like it’s going to be 20% for European products. We have 2 containers on the way to the US right now, 50% of the product already is sold and we cannot change the pricing on it. This will be so detrimental to our company and I just don’t know what we should do. Many users have discussed adding “tariff charge” line items to their receipts so that customers understand the increased prices are a result of the Trump administration’s economic policies, not random price gouging. On one small business owner’s thread, a commenter said: “Let people know it’s tariffs that are at fault for your higher prices. If it’s true, it passes some of the blame from you to the administration, which can help change things. A lot of people don’t watch the news, and they should know that it’s directly affecting them.” One misinformed user made the unfortunate decision to create a post asking fellow r/smallbusiness Redditors whether they thought Trump’s tariffs would “help small business owners.” The retribution was ruthless and swift. “LOL,” one user posted. “LMFAO.” “This is a dumb fucking question,” another chimed in. “It will definitely help some businesses,” another added. “Mainly bankruptcy lawyers and undertakers.” \nChinaDonald TrumpReddit  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          It's the Art of the Deal.\n         \n          The destruction of the Trump regime will be felt for generations.\n         \n          If the White House has an authoritarian toolkit to use on civil protesters, you can thank Biden for it.\n         \n          Tesla's factory in Shanghai only produces the carmaker's more affordable models, with the Model S and X imported from the U.S.\n         \n          A senior official describes the billionaire as an awkward and obnoxious asshole.\n         \n          On again, off again.",

    "full_content": "President Donald Trump's slew of broad tariffs target dozens of countries, including many key US trading partners. A range of goods Americans rely on will be affected. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to implement broad tariffs on over 180 countries that have placed tariffs on US goods. On top of a 10% baseline tariff, the president said he'll impose additional double-digit tariffs that the administration argued were based on tariffs and other trade barriers those countries placed on the US. \"They do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple. Can't get any simpler than that,\" Trump said during his remarks. Some affected countries have already warned of retaliatory tariffs following Trump's announcement; Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said during a speech ahead of Trump's executive order that \"we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it.\" Here are the top goods the US imports from some of the major countries hit by Trump's newest tariffs. Trump announced a 34% tariff on goods imported from China in addition to the earlier 20% tariff he placed on them last month. The US imported $438.9 billion worth of goods from China in 2024. Census Bureau data showed that radio and television broadcasting and wireless communications equipment were major imports from China in 2024. Computers, apparel, and footwear were among the top goods imported based on dollar value. Trump announced a 20% tariff on goods imported from the European Union. The US imported $605.8 billion worth of goods from the EU in 2024. Some of the key imports from the EU based on 2024 data involve healthcare-related goods, including pharmaceutical preparations. Trump announced a 46% tariff on goods imported from Vietnam. The US imported about $136.6 billion worth of goods from the country in 2024. The top 10 imports from Vietnam in 2024 based on dollar value included computer-related and other equipment, furniture, and semiconductors. Trump announced a 32% tariff on goods imported from Taiwan. The US imported about $116.3 billion worth of goods from the country in 2024. The top 10 imports from Taiwan in 2024 included various kinds of electronic and computer equipment, fasteners, and semiconductors.  Trump announced a 24% tariff on goods imported from Japan. The US imported $148.2 billion worth of goods from the country in 2024. Vehicles, vehicle parts, and motors were among the top 10 goods imported from Japan in 2024.",

    "full_content": "Most semiconductors, the silicon microchips that run everything from TV remote controls to humanoid robots are exempt from the slew of tariffs rolled out by the Trump administration last week. But that's not the end of the story for the industry which also powers the immense shift in computing toward artificial intelligence that's already underway, led by the US. There are roughly $45 billion worth of semiconductors (based on 2024 totals gathered by Bernstein), that remain tariff-free — $12 billion of which comes from Taiwan, where AI chip leader Nvidia manufactures. But, the AI ecosystem requires much more than chips alone. Data centers and the myriad materials and components required to generate depictions of everyone as an anime character are not exempt. For instance, an imported remote-controlled toy car with chips in both components would need an exception for toys, to avoid fees. \"We still have more questions than answers about this,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a note sent to investors Thursday morning. \"Semiconductors are exempt. But what about modules? Cards?\" As of Friday morning, analysts were still scratching their heads as to the impact, despite the exemption. \"We're not exactly sure what to do with all this,\" wrote Bernstein's analysts. \"Most semiconductors enter the US inside other things for which tariffs are likely to have a much bigger influence, hence secondary effects are likely to be far more material.\" Nvidia designs chips and software, but what it mainly sells are boards, according to Dylan Patel, chief analyst at Semianalysis. Boards contain multiple chips, but also power delivery controls, and other components to make them work. \"On the surface, the exemption does not exempt Nvidia shipments as they ship GPU board assemblies,\" Patel told Business Insider. \"If accelerator boards are excluded in addition to semiconductors, then the cost would not go up much,\" he continued. These boards are just the beginning of the bumper crop of AI data centers in the works right now. Server racks, steel cabinets, and all the cabling, cooling gear, and switches to manage data flow and power are mostly imported. A spokesperson for AMD, which, like Nvidia, produces its AI chips in Taiwan, told BI the company is closely monitoring the regulations. \"Although semiconductors are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, we are assessing the details and any impacts on our broader customer and partner ecosystem,\" the spokesperson said in an email statement. Nvidia declined to comment on the implications of the tariffs. But CEO Jensen Huang got the question from financial analysts last month at the company's annual GTC conference. \"We're preparing and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore,\" he said. Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC has invested $100 billion in a manufacturing facility in Arizona. \"We are now running production silicon in Arizona. And so, we will manufacture onshore. The rest of the systems, we'll manufacture as much onshore as we need to,\" Huang said. \"We have a super agile supply chain, we're manufacturing in so many different places, we could shift things,\" he continued. In addition to potentially producing chips in the US, it's plausible that companies, including Nvidia, could do more of their final assembly in the US, Chris Miller, the author of \"Chip War\" and a leading expert on the semiconductor industry told BI. Moving the later steps of the manufacturing process to un-tariffed shores, which right now include Canada and Mexico as well as the US, could theoretically allow these companies to import bare silicon chips and avoid levies. But that change would come with a cost as well, Miller said. With retaliatory tariffs rolling in, US manufacturers could find tariffs weighing down demand in international markets too. Semiconductor industry veteran Sachin Gandhi just brought his startup Retym out of stealth mode last week, with a semiconductor that helps data move between data centers faster. Technology like his has been most relevant to the telecom industry for decades and is now finding new markets in AI data centers. Retym's finished product is exempt from tariffs when it enters the US, but the semiconductor supply chain is complex. Products often cross borders while being manufactured in multiple steps, packaged, tested, and validated, and then shipped to the final destination. A global tariff-rich environment will probably bring up his costs in one way or another, Gandhi told BI. End customers like hyperscalers and the ecosystem of middlemen who bundle all these elements together and sell them will figure out how to cover these costs without too much consternation to a point, he said. \"Demand is not particularly price sensitive,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore Thursday. AI is already an area where companies appear willing to spend with abandon. But, it's also maturing. Now, when companies are working to put together realistic estimates for normal business metrics like return on investment, unit economics, and profitability, tariffs risk pushing that down the road, potentially years.

    "full_content": "The Google Pixel 9a launched on Mar. 19, and we were taken by surprise when the tech giant didn't give us information on preorders or in-store launch dates. Now, ten days later, the company announced that the budget phones will be out in stores starting April 10. Google usually makes all its devices available for pre-orders on launch day, but for the Pixel 9a, we were told that it would show up in stores \"sometime in April\" without a concrete date. There's a good reason why Google wanted to hold back preorders; it said the first Pixel 9a units had a \"component quality issue\" and that it wanted to make sure that the phone was functioning as it was supposed to before being released to the masses.  In a community post, the company detailed its rollout plan, starting with users in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., who will get to buy the Pixel 9a as early as April 10, while folks in European countries will be able to get the device on April 14. As for Australia, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia — they will see the budget phone in store on April 16. Google also states that the Pixel 9a will be \"coming soon\" to Japan; however, a specific date hasn't been confirmed yet. The tech giant added that the \"Pixel 9a will be available at the Google Store and through our retail partners beginning in April, and you can sign up today to get notified as soon as it's available.\"  Debuting at $499 in two new colorways: Iris and Peony, the Pixel 9a comes with the fastest Tensor G4 chip, gets up to 30 plus hours of battery life, and can do almost everything that the standard Pixel 9 phone can. Right off the bat, the Pixel 9a sports an all-new look, ditching its usual pill-shaped camera bump and housing the rear cameras within the phone. For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen. Like the other Pixel 9 devices, this budget phone also gets Android 15 out of the box and seven years of OS and security updates. The phone comes with all the latest AI features, including Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, and more. Lastly, Google didn't mention when users can start pre-ordering the Pixel 9a, but anyone interested can hit the \"get notified\" button on the Google Store to be the first to know when the phone will be available online. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android   Battery & brightness boost The Google Pixel 9a shed its camera bar to keep a (relatively) slim profile, taking inspiration from the Pixel Watch for its cameras.

    "full_content": "If you've been following iPhone rumors over the last few years, you may remember reading reports that Apple flirted with the idea of introducing a super high-end \"Ultra\" model that would either replace its Pro Max device or sit above it in Apple's smartphone hirearchy. These reports appeared in the pre-launch iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, but ultimately came to nothing. Now though, the rumor is back.  Citing sources from Weibo, Taiwan, \"US investment report content,\" and supply chain trends, the Korean news aggregator account \"yeux1122\" on the Naver blog has summarized \"rumors regarding Apple's iPhone 17 Ultra name change.\" The blog begins by highlighting the following rumored changes that have so far been attributed to various models in the upcoming iPhone 17 series: Analyst Jeff Pu in October said that the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max will have a narrower Dynamic Island, but the claim has since been disputed by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Nevertheless, the Naver blog claims that, based on component orders for a smaller Dynamic Island, the supply volume is \"insufficient\" to cover both iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, intimating that only the larger \"Ultra\" device will feature one.    The Naver blog also asserts that only the \"Ultra\" device will feature a vapor chamber cooling system, despite competing rumors claiming that it will come either to both Pro models or all iPhone 17 models.  Lastly, the blog claims that the \"Ultra\" model will be thicker than the iPhone 17 Pro, owing to a larger battery. This rumor is the only one that we know of that has only been tied to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. If it was exhaustive, the blog could have also pointed to the 12GB of RAM that Kuo in August said would be coming to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. However, Pu has pushed back on this prediction and believes that both Pro models will get 12GB, up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro models. It could also have included Kuo's prediction last year that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be the first iPhone to feature three 48MP cameras, although that claim has since been challenged by a Chinese leaker.\n As a result of changes allegedly destined for Apple's largest high-end model, the blog claims that this year's iPhone 17 lineup will look like so: This differentiation strategy would arguably help Apple justify a higher price point for an \"Ultra\" iPhone model with more advanced features. And let's not forget that Apple already has an established naming convention where \"Air,\" \"Pro,\" and \"Ultra\" denote distinct tiers across various product categories. For instance, the MacBook Air and iPad Air represent lightweight, consumer-friendly options, while \"Pro\" models cater to professional users seeking enhanced performance. The \"Ultra\" designation introduced with products like the Apple Watch Ultra signifies a top-tier offering with better capabilities. And then there's the most powerful Apple silicon chip to date – the M3 Ultra. Whether Apple adopts the Ultra moniker for its most premium iPhone 17 model remains to be seen, but we do know that Apple has internally discussed the possibility for previous generations. Barring further corroboration from trusted sources, we'll have to wait and see when the iPhone 17 lineup launches later this year around Apple's usual mid-September time frame.",

    "full_content": "Kevin Bates says his gadget business was a “miracle of global trade,” one that is now going away. Kevin Bates says his gadget business was a “miracle of global trade,” one that is now going away. by  Sean Hollister Kevin Bates managed to quit his day job and move to China after his game-playing business card, the Arduboy, went viral in 2014. But a decade later, Trump’s staggering and inexplicable new US tariffs are driving him out of business. Just as he was about to turn a profit for the first time, just before he was about to bring a new product to retail, he tells The Verge that his company can no longer survive as-is. He says that despite lifetime Arduboy sales of over $1 million, much of it from recent growth in 2023 and 2024, Trump’s new 104 percent China tariffs will be the beginning of the end. “I just like making circuit boards and helping people learn to code games. This is all too much,” he says. Even if he wanted to — Bates admits he’s been looking to sunset Arduboy for a while — he says he wouldn’t be able to satisfy Trump’s stated goal of restarting manufacturing in the US. “There are no manufacturers in the USA who would even answer an email to produce Arduboy, much less give a good price. I could build them myself and end up making about $10 an hour, still paying a crazy amount for components.” Instead, he says, his options are to dramatically raise prices, find a way around the tariffs, or simply kill off Arduboy for good. “The fact Arduboy could exist at all was kind of a miracle of global trade. An individual person, producing and distributing an international product with margins that would never work at a larger company. I didn’t need 80 percent markup to survive,” he says, adding that his actual margins ranged from 30 to 50 percent. Trump’s US tariffs would entirely wipe out those margins, and he says China’s retaliatory tariffs would hurt too, as they would impose a 34 percent tariff on the Arduboy’s US-made processor, which Bates says is the most expensive component in the system. While he’s hopeful that some larger organization might buy Arduboy and take up the torch, he admits that’s not terribly realistic in this economic climate, and he’s already declaring Arduboy “dead” on his LinkedIn and in the Arduboy forums. He’s already looking for a new day job once again. But he says Arduboy isn’t quite dead yet. He wants to launch one last Kickstarter for a USB-C version of the Arduboy with “more features like real time clock, IR blaster, and link cable support,” assuming he can figure out how to ship them at a price people will pay. He says he already saw $99 Arduboy FX Special Edition as overpriced for what it is, and he isn’t looking forward to charging $200 for a new version or saddling buyers with customs fees should he choose to drop-ship them. “The only realistic solution is to warehouse the inventory somewhere that doesn’t have Chinese import taxes, and drop ship everything. I visited my factory last year to talk about this, and they said all their customers are in the same situation so they said they would have a solution. But one has not materialized yet,” he says. Speaking of drop-shipping and customs fees, that is probably what you should expect if you buy the new banana-shaped Arduboy or the last few remaining units of the Arduboy FX Special Edition. “I am planning to fulfill the orders but they may be drop shipped, so U.S. customers should be aware that import taxes may now apply,” he tells The Verge. But he also may just turn off Banana-Bit preorders, as he says he’s only sold about a dozen so far. He also warns these packages could get held up at US customs for a time, because Trump has also gotten rid of the de minimis exemption that let low-value packages enter the US duty-free. “That’s going to impact everything from Shein to Temu to AliExpress, and honestly, it’s going to be chaos. U.S. customs isn’t ready for that volume,” he says. Bates says Trump’s trade war is “an absolute unmitigated disaster for anyone without the ability to dramatically restructure.” “I guess that’s the point,” he adds.

    "full_content": "Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration and Ministry of Public Security has outlawed the use of facial recognition without consent. The two orgs last Friday published new rules on facial recognition and an explainer that spell out how orgs that want to use facial recognition must first conduct a “personal information protection impact assessment” that considers whether using the tech is necessary, impacts on individuals’ privacy, and risks of data leakage. Organizations that decide to use facial recognition must data encrypt biometric data, and audit the information security techniques and practices they use to protect facial scans. Chinese that go through that process and decide they want to use facial recognition can only do so after securing individuals’ consent. The rules also ban the use of facial recognition equipment in public places such as hotel rooms, public bathrooms, public dressing rooms, and public toilets. The measures don’t apply to researchers or to what machine translation of the rules describes as “algorithm training activities” – suggesting images of citizens’ faces are fair game when used to train AI models. The documents linked to above don’t mention whether government agencies are exempt from the new rules. The Register fancies Beijing will keep using facial recognition whenever it wants to as its previously expressed interest in a national identity scheme that uses the tech, and used it to identify members of ethnic minorities. Zoho has won the competition to create a made-in-India web browser that the nation’s government will champion as ideal for local users. India’s government launched the Web Browser Development Challenge in 2023 and called for competitors to develop apps that use a root certificate issued by the nation’s Controller of Certifying Authorities so local users would not be dependent on certificates issued by entities controlled by other government. Zoho’s Ulaa browser won the competition the company won ₹1 Crore ($115,000) to ensure its compatibility with iOS, Windows, and Android. Two startups, Team PING and Team Ajna, were named as first and second runners up. India’s government hasn’t outlined a plan to have device-makers adopt the browsers, which may be hard to achieve as the nation’s dominant mobile carrier Jio is so close to Google that the two collaborated on a custom version of Android for low cost home brand handsets. Cisco’s Talos threat-hunters last week reported attacks on critical infrastructure in Taiwan, including telecommunications, healthcare, and information technology operations, by a crew that uses similar tactics to those employed by the probably-China-backed Volt Typhoon and Flax Typhoon crews. Talos named the group “UAT-5918” and assessed it as “motivated by establishing long-term access for information theft, uses a combination of web shells and open-sourced tooling to conduct post-compromise activities to establish persistence in victim environments for information theft and credential harvesting.” UAT-5918 often gains access by exploiting a known, and unpatched, vulnerability. Once it compromises and org, it moves laterally and looks for juicy info to exfiltrate. Elon Musk’s social network X has reportedly sued the government of India over laws that allow content takedowns. India has argued it needs laws to take down content that could threaten national security, but its government has sometimes decided that posts about mass protests against its policies should be taken down. X’s court filing, seen by Reuters, aims to fight India’s laws on grounds they violate freedom of speech. Japan’s government last week tabled a new cybersecurity bill that will shift the nation to an “active defense” stance – including offensive operations against offshore targets felt to represent a threat to national security. Digital Minister Masaaki Taira said the law follows international norms. The bill faces opposition at home as it allows Japan’s government to obtain info from operators of critical infrastructure such as electricity and railways to obtain communications information to monitor for potential cyberattacks. Minister Taira assured Japan’s parliament personal information is not the target, and assured lawmakers that the bill includes safeguards that will preserve privacy. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a think tank founded and funded by Australia’s government, last week claimed it had become the target of Chinese trolls after publishing research critical of the Middle Kingdom. “Staff have been threatened, harassed & abused, with female staff targeted most viciously. Most of the claims made in Chinese state media are false, including that ASPI has halted its China research,” wrote ASPI executive director Justin Bassi. ® Send us news",

    "full_content": "The Chinese military officials in brown uniforms fan out around rows of young trees, shoveling soil into freshly dug pits. The camera pans to the most senior leaders one by one, in order of rank. But one prominent face is conspicuously absent.\n     \n            The news segment, aired Wednesday night on China’s state broadcaster, features a tree-planting event in the outskirts of the capital Beijing – an annual springtime tradition for the country’s military leadership spanning more than four decades.\n     \n            But Gen. He Weidong, the second-highest-ranking uniformed officer in the People’s Liberation Army, was nowhere to be seen. Nor was he named as a participant in a report by the official state news agency.\n     \n            Gen. He’s absence from the high-profile event has fueled ongoing speculation that the second-ranking vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) may have become the latest – and most senior – casualty in leader Xi Jinping’s purge of the military’s top ranks.\n     \n            As Xi’s No.2 general, He shares a long-standing relationship with the Chinese leader, dating back decades to the early days of their careers in the coastal province of Fujian.\n     \n            Rumors about an investigation against He first surfaced among the Chinese dissident community following China’s annual political meetings last month. The 67-year-old hasn’t appeared in public for three weeks since the closing ceremony of the country’s rubber-stamp legislature on March 11.\n     \n            The Chinese government has offered little in the way of clearing the air.\n     \n            When asked about He’s situation at a news briefing on March 27, Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said: “There is no information on this matter, and we are not aware of the situation.”\n     \n            It is now unclear what has happened to He, who also sits on the Communist Party’s 24-member Politburo.\n     \n            Three weeks out of the public eye is not unheard of for a top general without a public-facing role and there is always a chance he resurfaces. But his no-show at a well-choreographed annual propaganda event stands out in a political system deeply attuned to the importance of symbolism.\n     \n            “Clearly the absence of one CMC vice chair is important symbolically,” said James Char, a longtime PLA expert and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n     \n            Similar to the Communist Party Congresses and annual “two sessions” political gatherings, “it’s important for all the major figures that the rest of the world know of to show up to be in the same picture, because it helps to demonstrate the power and – more importantly – the unity of the party,” Char said.\n     \n            In the opaque world of Chinese politics, observers have long leaned on arcane signals of Communist Party traditions and protocol to interpret what is going on behind the scenes. The discipline, known as “tea-leaf reading,” has become more relevant than ever in Xi’s era as he centralizes power into his own hands and makes the decision-making process even more obscure.\n     \n            And now, some experts are scouring this week’s events for clues on the fate of one of Xi’s top generals.\n     \n            The annual ritual began as part of a nationwide tree-planting campaign launched by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in late 1981, following devastating floods he blamed on rampant deforestation. It was billed as a patriotic, selfless undertaking in “greening the motherland, building socialism and benefiting future generations.”\n     \n            The following spring, Deng, then chairman of the CMC, planted the first tree of the campaign, setting a tradition that has since been carried on by successive Chinese leaders and military top brass.\n     \n            Wednesday marked “the 43rd consecutive year the CMC leadership has collectively participated in the voluntary tree-planting activity in the capital,” said Xinhua, the state news agency.\n     \nRelated article\nXi brought down powerful rivals in the military. Now he’s going after his own men\n \n            Since Xi came to power in late 2012, his two vice chairmen on the CMC had led military officers to plant trees without fail every spring – until He’s rare absence on Wednesday.\n     \n            The first-ranking CMC vice chairman, Gen. Zhang Youxia, attended the event, so did two other generals on the commission, Liu Zhenli and Zhang Shengmin.\n     \n            The only other uniformed CMC member who did not show up was Adm. Miao Hua, who was suspended under investigation in November for “serious violations of discipline” – a common euphemism for corruption and disloyalty.\n     \n            “I think He’s absence is quite telling, but again, no one can be absolutely sure,” Char said. “There’s another school of thought, which is He Weidong was involved in the last two weeks with the preparations for the military exercises around Taiwan.”\n     \n            Starting from Tuesday, combined forces of the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command held surprise exercises around Taiwan for two straight days, testing capabilities to blockade the self-ruling island, simulate strikes on its ports and other critical infrastructure, and launch long-range live-fire strikes.\n     \n            The commander of the Eastern Theater Command from 2019 to 2022 was He. It was during his tenure that the Eastern Theater Command staged massive military drills and fired missiles around Taiwan in August 2022, in retaliation against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.\n     \n            A prolonged absence from public view does not always signal trouble for Chinese officials. Some have resurfaced and resumed their duties. It’s also not uncommon for officials to be taken in for questioning by graft busters to assist investigations into colleagues.\n     \n            Last November, Defense Minister Dong Jun was reported to be under investigation for corruption by the Financial Times, citing US officials. China’s Defense Ministry dismissed the report as a “sheer fabrication.” Dong reemerged in public a week later. The minister was also seen attending Wednesday’s tree-planting event on the state broadcaster.\n     \n            After coming to power, Xi consolidated control over the world’s largest military by taking down powerful generals from rival factions and replacing them with allies and loyal proteges.\n     \n            But a decade on, having structurally overhauled the People’s Liberation Army and stacked its top ranks with his own men, Xi is still knee-deep in his seemingly endless struggle against graft and disloyalty – and is increasingly turning against his own handpicked loyalists.\n     \n            Since the summer of 2023, more than a dozen high-ranking figures in China’s defense establishment have been ousted in a sweeping purge that focused on the country’s nuclear force and equipment procurement, including two defense ministers promoted to the CMC by Xi.\n     \n            The ongoing turmoil roiling the senior ranks of the PLA has raised questions over Xi’s ability to end systemic corruption in the military and enhance its combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions.\n     \nRelated article\nHow ready is China’s military? Dramatic downfall of two defense ministers raises questions\n \n            “Recurring purges of the senior-most PLA leaders indicate that Xi Jinping distrusts his officer corps,” said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the RSIS.\n     \n            “The constant removal of so many senior officers, as well as the extent of corruption running to the very top undoubtedly has an effect on the PLA’s morale, and likely also its military capabilities,” Thompson added.\n     \n            But some analysts noted that by this point, the PLA may have well become accustomed to the shake-ups in its high command.\n     \n            “Leadership purges in the PLA seem to have become normalized to a point that it’s just part and parcel of being the PLA,” said Collin Koh, another research fellow at RSIS.\n     \n            The Chinese military may have started to grow accustomed to the purges – to a point where it is able to isolate them from its daily operational activities and go on with business as usual, Koh noted.\n     \n            “It does not necessarily mean that because of the purges, the PLA has started to relent on readiness. These purges might potentially have the effect of reminding the PLA to do their work better – if anything, if you want to escape the purges, then one way to do that is to obey what the party is telling you, which is to be prepared for conflict,” he said.\n     \n            Like Miao, He is widely believed to have forged close personal ties with Xi during their overlapping years in Fujian, where the future Chinese leader was rising through the ranks as a local official in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n     \n            Both He and Miao spent most of their early career serving in the former 31st Group Army in Fujian, which became a major power base for Xi. A string of military officers hailing from the 31st Group Army have been fast-tracked for promotion since Xi took power in late 2012.\n     \n            Gen. He was no exception. In 2013, he was promoted to commander of Jiangsu Military District; less than a year later, he became commander of the Shanghai Garrison. In 2016, he was promoted yet again to command ground forces of the Western Theater Command, which oversees China’s border with India.\n     \n            He was promoted to full general in 2017, when he became commander of the Eastern Theater Command, responsible for leading any military invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n     \n            But the ultimate sign of Xi’s trust in He came at the 20th Party Congress in 2022, when He landed the CMC vice chairmanship – an unusually rapid rise for an official who hadn’t served on the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party.\n     \n            During that leadership reshuffle, Xi stacked the CMC with six loyalists. If confirmed to be under investigation, He would be the powerful military body’s first sitting vice chairman to be purged by Xi and the third member on the current CMC to fall from grace.\n     \n            The last time a sitting CMC vice chair was purged was more than three decades ago, when then-Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was ousted for sympathizing with student protesters in the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement.\n     \n            “What happens finally to He Weidong gives us a window into how the political system in China is being restructured further under Xi Jinping,” Char said, noting the PLA’s reform of its rigid political structure.\n     \n            “I don’t think anyone in the system now is irreplaceable,” he said. “This is what a political strong man does. He’s ruthless… he’s continuously purging his own ranks to keep his generals on their toes.”",

    "full_content": "Moving iPhone production from China to the United States could increase manufacturing costs by up to 90%, analysts at Bank of America warned on Wednesday (via Bloomberg). According to BofA analysts led by Wamsi Mohan, shifting iPhone assembly to America is technically possible, however it would dramatically increase production expenses and create logistical complications. \"iPhone cost can increase 25% purely on higher labor cost in the U.S.,\" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. They explained that even if Apple finds domestic workers for final assembly, a \"significant portion\" of iPhone components would still need to be manufactured in China and imported to the States. Assuming Apple faces reciprocal tariffs on those imported components, the total manufacturing cost could rise by 90% or more, the analysts estimated. The analysis follows statements from President Trump earlier this week calling Apple's manufacturing in China \"unsustainable.\" According to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump \"absolutely\" believes Apple could manufacture iPhones in the United States. During a recent media briefing, Leavitt said the President believes \"we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.\" Trump's aggressive trade policies singled out China on Wednesday, pausing reciprocal tariffs on 185 countries for 90 days but increasing duties on Chinese imports to 125%. In response, China has imposed 84% retaliatory levies on American goods. It's becoming increasingly difficult to assess where the stand-off goes from here. Uncertainty caused by the trade war has battered Apple's stock, which has fallen 14% since Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, erasing approximately $479 billion in market capitalization. Despite a recent 10% rebound, Apple shares remain down 23% year-to-date. For Apple to make U.S. assembly economically viable, Mohan suggests the company would need tariff waivers on components and subassemblies manufactured outside the country. However, he doesn't believe this is likely to happen. \"Unless it becomes clear as to how permanent the new tariffs are, we do not expect Apple to take the step of moving manufacturing into the U.S.,\" Mohan stated. Instead, he anticipates Apple will \"continue to diversify its supply chain, and also increase production of iPhones in other countries such as India.\" Apple has not officially commented on how it plans to address the current tariff situation. Apple will need to pay the 125% tariff on all goods coming to the United States from China, but it can import devices from other countries like India, Taiwan, and Vietnam at the lower 10% rate.

    "full_content": "A skier in Colorado had a close call this past weekend. A video taken Sunday by an employee at the Keystone Ski Resort in Keystone, Colorado, shows skier Brian O'Neal coming down the slopes at the same time as a black bear appears out of nowhere and runs in his direction. Luckily, the skier managed to avoid a closer encounter and the bear disappeared into a nearby forest. “All of a sudden from the right side of my eye, side-vision, it was like, 'Oh crap, here comes something,'” O’Neal told Summit Daily News. “Usually, you might see moose up there, but I’ve never seen a bear.” In an interview with Storyful, the resort employee who took the video said that he and some friends had gone out to look for the bear after hearing of people having encounters with the animal. \"We found the bear while he was walking through the trees of connecting runs,\" Nathan Lynch said. \"So, me and my friends went to the run that the bear was heading to next and waited for him to run out. When he did, I thankfully had my camera out.\" O'Neal told Summit Daily News that the incident happened on his first ski run of the day. “It happened so quick,” O’Neal said. “I was just trying not to run into it.” It was the last day for skiing at the resort for the season, the outlet reported.

    "full_content": "President Trump believes iPhone manufacturing could shift to the US very quickly. He's wrong —  it won't happen during his term, if it happens at all.\r During a press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to a question about whether Trump believes iPhone production could ultimately move to the U.S. Apparently, President Trump thinks the United States has the resources and the workforce necessary for such an endeavor.\rLeavitt said that Trump was looking to bring manufacturing jobs \"back home\" to the United States and that he was \"looking at advanced technologies,\" among other things:\rSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe president wants to increase manufacturing jobs here in the United States of America, but he's also looking at advanced technologies. He's also looking at AI and emerging fields that are growing around the world that the United States needs to be a leader in as well. There's an array of diverse jobs. More traditional manufacturing jobs, as you discussed, and also jobs in advanced technologies. The president is looking at all of those. He wants them to come back home.The question referenced a recent statement by the U.S. Secretary of State Howard Lutnick, who said that \"the army of millions and millions of people screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones\" would be coming to America. Leavitt's response indicates that President Trump agrees with Lutnick's assessment.\rThe use of \"screws\" in this context is a gross over-simplification of iPhone assembly, which should be incredibly obvious to even the most casual observer. Multiple high-tech components, material suppliers, and manufacturers are also involved, as Apple sources finished components from the likes of Sony, LG, and, of course, TSMC for Apple Silicon chips.\rIn a follow-up question, Leavitt was asked specifically about iPhone production in the United States, and whether that type of technology could be brought over. \r\"Absolutely,\" Leavitt remarked, adding that President Trump believes the U.S. has the necessary resources for iPhone manufacturing. \rTo support that claim, Leavitt said that Apple wouldn't have invested $500 billion in the United States if they believed the country couldn't handle iPhone assembly. In reality, the $500B U.S. investment referenced by Leavitt has very little to do with the iPhone, almost nothing to do overall with Apple hardware manufacturing, and isn't anything out of the ordinary for Apple, as it is nearly all prior announcements. \rThese remarks are all made despite the United States not having a single iPhone assembly facility that takes four or more years to build, does not have inexpensive and skilled labor that can take decades to foster, has to import nearly all of rare earth materials to make an iPhone that will all be tariffed on their own, and there are no sub-assembly factories to use those raw materials necessary for iPhone component production.\rIn short, the entire supply chain for the iPhone doesn't exist in the US. Most of it would have to be generated from scratch.\rThis will take at least five years without training a labor force. That may take an entire generation. It will certainly take longer than Trump's term in office.\rU.S. production of Apple chips is actually five years behind TaiwanIt's not all lacking. There is one notable exception.\rSome Apple chips are already made in Arizona, though they're far from the latest and greatest technology. Apple partner TSMC began construction on its Arizona chip production facility back in 2020, and it took more than four years to begin manufacturing from the first ceremonial shovel-full of dirt to announcements that production has begun.\r TSMC'S Arizona manufacturing facilities are around five years behind its Taiwan operations.TSMC's Arizona facility currently produces Apple's A16 Bionic chip found in the standard iPhone 15. It also makes a SIP (system-in-package) for the Apple Watch, but both chips use the dated N4 four-nanometer production process.\rA second TSMC facility is scheduled to be opened in 2027 or 2028, which might be used for the production of more modern 3nm chips. The iPhone 15 Pro, for instance, features a 3nm A17 Pro chip, as do devices that belong to the current iPhone 16 range, with the A18 line of system-on-chips.\rA third TSMC factory, subsidized by the U.S with $6.6B, will reportedly produce 2nm chips by 2030. Currently, Apple is expected to include a 2nm A20 chip in the iPhone 18 Pro, which will likely reach end consumers in 2026. At that rate, it would effectively take TSMC four years to start producing a then-dated chip in the United States.\rIf true, this means that TSMC's US manufacturing efforts are a whole five years behind its Taiwan operations, indicating that the latest Apple chips likely won't be made in the United States for the foreseeable future. Probably close to a decade.\rUnder Taiwanese law, domestic chip manufacturers, such as TSMC, are allowed to produce chips elsewhere in the world. The catch is that they must be at least one generation behind fabrication facilities operated in Taiwan.\rIn November 2024, Taiwan Minister of Economic Affairs J. W. Kuo said that TSMC must keep producing chips using the latest production processes in its home country. \r\"Since Taiwan has related regulations to protect its own technologies, TSMC cannot produce 2-nanometer chips overseas currently,\" Kuo said at the time. \"Although TSMC plans to make 2-nanometer chips [abroad] in the future, its core technology will stay in Taiwan.\"\rThis effectively means couldn't produce the latest and greatest Apple chips in the United States, even if the company wanted to do so. Still, this is not the only reason why large-scale iPhone production isn't feasible in the United States, as the devices require plenty of other components.\rMade in USA iPhones are an unlikely scenario at bestNearly 90% of iPhones are currently produced in China, mainly by Apple suppliers Foxconn and Luxshare, among others. Other countires, such as India, only account for about 10% to 15% of total iPhone production, and that's typically been for good reason.\r Apple has an R&D center in Austin, but large-scale manufacturing would be effectively impossible. Image Credit: AppleThe United States lacks cheap labor with the skillset suitable for iPhone manufacturing, which is, in contrast, readily available overseas. Foxconn and other suppliers also have existing facilities, with assembly lines that have produced Apple products for generations over multiple years. If Apple wanted to move large-scale iPhone production to the United States, it would effectively have to start from scratch.\rIn December 2022, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the use of US-made A16 chips in Apple products was \"only the beginning.\" Cook explained that Apple was \"investing in a stronger, brighter future, we are planting our seed in the Arizona desert.\" Apple wanted to \"nurture its growth,\" but that growth ultimately took years.\rTSMC's Arizona facility alone took four years to complete, and that facility only produces a single component. Apple would need to source land and all sorts of raw materials and resources for its US manufacturing efforts. The United States also lacks finished goods. Some iPhone components, such as the device's cameras, are sourced from companies such as Sony, and the same goes for the device displays.\rApple would still need to import all of these individual parts and core hardware components, as it is highly unlikely that an effective substitute would be found in a U.S.-based company or manufacturing facility. Even if one was found, this would still drive costs up, and consumers might not be willing to deal with increased prices.\rWhat are Apple's actual plans for the immediate future?Though President Trump believes iPhone manufacturing could return to the United States, the reality is that won't happen anytime soon.\r Apple reportedly wants to import more iPhones from India. Image Credit: AppleApple understandably wants to keep manufacturing costs low. To do so it needs to avoid Trump's planned tariffs on goods produced in China and elsewhere. \rThat's why Apple has reportedly been stock-piling current-generation products. It's also why the company supposedly has plans to increase iPhone imports from India soon. \rNot in the US. In India. That effort has been going on for years already.\rIndia has a much lower 26% tariff compared to the staggering 104% Trump has planned for China. Still, many believe Apple will increase iPhone prices as a result, with one report predicting a 43% more expensive iPhone in September 2025.\rConsumers are already panic-buying current-generation products, and that trend will likely continue until a solution is found. While unlikely, Apple may secure a tariff exemption again, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has a way of negotiating with President Trump.\rIn any case, moving manufacturing efforts to the United States wouldn't solve any problems. Even if, through some miracle, Apple managed to source all components domestically, plants started up instantly, and a skilled workforce manifested magically, that would drive costs through the roof, and US consumers likely wouldn't put up with it.  During a press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to a question about whether Trump believes iPhone production could ultimately move to the U.S. Apparently, President Trump thinks the United States has the resources and the workforce necessary for such an endeavor.\r Leavitt said that Trump was looking to bring manufacturing jobs \"back home\" to the United States and that he was \"looking at advanced technologies,\" among other things:\r The question referenced a recent statement by the U.S. Secretary of State Howard Lutnick, who said that \"the army of millions and millions of people screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones\" would be coming to America. Leavitt's response indicates that President Trump agrees with Lutnick's assessment.\r The use of \"screws\" in this context is a gross over-simplification of iPhone assembly, which should be incredibly obvious to even the most casual observer. Multiple high-tech components, material suppliers, and manufacturers are also involved, as Apple sources finished components from the likes of Sony, LG, and, of course, TSMC for Apple Silicon chips.\r In a follow-up question, Leavitt was asked specifically about iPhone production in the United States, and whether that type of technology could be brought over. \r \"Absolutely,\" Leavitt remarked, adding that President Trump believes the U.S. has the necessary resources for iPhone manufacturing. \r To support that claim, Leavitt said that Apple wouldn't have invested $500 billion in the United States if they believed the country couldn't handle iPhone assembly. In reality, the $500B U.S. investment referenced by Leavitt has very little to do with the iPhone, almost nothing to do overall with Apple hardware manufacturing, and isn't anything out of the ordinary for Apple, as it is nearly all prior announcements. \r These remarks are all made despite the United States not having a single iPhone assembly facility that takes four or more years to build, does not have inexpensive and skilled labor that can take decades to foster, has to import nearly all of rare earth materials to make an iPhone that will all be tariffed on their own, and there are no sub-assembly factories to use those raw materials necessary for iPhone component production.\r In short, the entire supply chain for the iPhone doesn't exist in the US. Most of it would have to be generated from scratch.\r This will take at least five years without training a labor force. That may take an entire generation. It will certainly take longer than Trump's term in office.\r It's not all lacking. There is one notable exception.\r Some Apple chips are already made in Arizona, though they're far from the latest and greatest technology. Apple partner TSMC began construction on its Arizona chip production facility back in 2020, and it took more than four years to begin manufacturing from the first ceremonial shovel-full of dirt to announcements that production has begun.\r TSMC's Arizona facility currently produces Apple's A16 Bionic chip found in the standard iPhone 15. It also makes a SIP (system-in-package) for the Apple Watch, but both chips use the dated N4 four-nanometer production process.\r A second TSMC facility is scheduled to be opened in 2027 or 2028, which might be used for the production of more modern 3nm chips. The iPhone 15 Pro, for instance, features a 3nm A17 Pro chip, as do devices that belong to the current iPhone 16 range, with the A18 line of system-on-chips.\r A third TSMC factory, subsidized by the U.S with $6.6B, will reportedly produce 2nm chips by 2030. Currently, Apple is expected to include a 2nm A20 chip in the iPhone 18 Pro, which will likely reach end consumers in 2026. At that rate, it would effectively take TSMC four years to start producing a then-dated chip in the United States.\r If true, this means that TSMC's US manufacturing efforts are a whole five years behind its Taiwan operations, indicating that the latest Apple chips likely won't be made in the United States for the foreseeable future. Probably close to a decade.\r Under Taiwanese law, domestic chip manufacturers, such as TSMC, are allowed to produce chips elsewhere in the world. The catch is that they must be at least one generation behind fabrication facilities operated in Taiwan.\r In November 2024, Taiwan Minister of Economic Affairs J. W. Kuo said that TSMC must keep producing chips using the latest production processes in its home country. \r \"Since Taiwan has related regulations to protect its own technologies, TSMC cannot produce 2-nanometer chips overseas currently,\" Kuo said at the time. \"Although TSMC plans to make 2-nanometer chips [abroad] in the future, its core technology will stay in Taiwan.\"\r This effectively means couldn't produce the latest and greatest Apple chips in the United States, even if the company wanted to do so. Still, this is not the only reason why large-scale iPhone production isn't feasible in the United States, as the devices require plenty of other components.\r Nearly 90% of iPhones are currently produced in China, mainly by Apple suppliers Foxconn and Luxshare, among others. Other countires, such as India, only account for about 10% to 15% of total iPhone production, and that's typically been for good reason.\r The United States lacks cheap labor with the skillset suitable for iPhone manufacturing, which is, in contrast, readily available overseas. Foxconn and other suppliers also have existing facilities, with assembly lines that have produced Apple products for generations over multiple years. If Apple wanted to move large-scale iPhone production to the United States, it would effectively have to start from scratch.\r In December 2022, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the use of US-made A16 chips in Apple products was \"only the beginning.\" Cook explained that Apple was \"investing in a stronger, brighter future, we are planting our seed in the Arizona desert.\" Apple wanted to \"nurture its growth,\" but that growth ultimately took years.\r TSMC's Arizona facility alone took four years to complete, and that facility only produces a single component. Apple would need to source land and all sorts of raw materials and resources for its US manufacturing efforts. The United States also lacks finished goods. Some iPhone components, such as the device's cameras, are sourced from companies such as Sony, and the same goes for the device displays.\r Apple would still need to import all of these individual parts and core hardware components, as it is highly unlikely that an effective substitute would be found in a U.S.-based company or manufacturing facility. Even if one was found, this would still drive costs up, and consumers might not be willing to deal with increased prices.\r Though President Trump believes iPhone manufacturing could return to the United States, the reality is that won't happen anytime soon.\r Apple understandably wants to keep manufacturing costs low. To do so it needs to avoid Trump's planned tariffs on goods produced in China and elsewhere. \r That's why Apple has reportedly been stock-piling current-generation products. It's also why the company supposedly has plans to increase iPhone imports from India soon. \r Not in the US. In India.

    "full_content": "Dead Talents Society’s John Hsu explains how World of Warcraft, Perfect Blue, and ‘the Taiwanese Logan Paul’ shaped him by  Tasha Robinson If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Not many people make the jump from YouTube video game parodist to feature filmmaker, but that just makes the few who do, like director John Hsu, all the more fascinating. Hsu spent 10 years making World of Warcraft parody machinima shorts for YouTube under Blizzard’s auspices before getting tapped to direct Detention, the film adaptation of the elegant historical-horror game of the same name. Hsu’s latest, the riotous horror-comedy Dead Talents Society, just hit Netflix, and he told Polygon it’s much more indicative of his personal voice: Detention is serious horror, but Dead Talents Society is an extended goof that makes fun of everything from influencer culture to reality TV to idol pop. Dead Talents Society is a dazzling, frantic film: It follows a group of ghosts trying to achieve fame and fortune in the afterlife. Donning gimmicky, flashy personas, these “ghostresses” try to become urban legends and attract clout-hungry debunkers who’ll spread their fame to the mortal realm. Catherine (Sandrine Pinna) is an award-winning former ghost superstar who haunts hotel rooms, but her protégé Jessica (Eleven Yao) has recently eclipsed her by haunting the entire internet. Enter “The Rookie” (Gingle Wang), a recently dead teenager who’s terrible at haunting. All these women (and other characters in the movie) died trying to be seen and recognized, and were killed by something representing the admiration they were chasing: smashed by a falling light during a shoot, crushed by a bookcase full of awards. Now they’re competing with each other even in death. It’s a silly prospect with an extremely goofy execution, but the movie has its sweet and sincere moments as well. And Hsu makes it clear there’s a lot of philosophy behind it all, and a lot of ingesting and reflecting an extensive array of forums where people seek attention, from social media to idol pop. Polygon talked to Hsu about World of Warcraft videos, Dead Talents Society’s pointed nod to Perfect Blue, and the cautionary tale of “the Taiwanese Logan Paul.” This interview has been edited for clarity and concision. Polygon: How did you get started making World of Warcraft videos for Blizzard? John Hsu: I’ve been a gamer since I was 5. I still play a lot of video games. During the release of World of Warcraft in Taiwan, Blizzard held a video contest to use World of Warcraft footage to make short films. Me and my two classmates, we all went to the same film school, and we all played World of Warcraft, so we submitted several videos. We actually won a contest, and Blizzard collaborated with us to make machinima videos. So we would shoot short films inside the game just to make fun of it. We had a YouTube channel back in 2010, called AFK PL@YERS. We had a lot of fans. When Dead Talents Society was released [in Taiwan], a lot of fans of our channel went to see the film, because we put in several references to those videos. For example, there’s one song we did during that period of time that we put in as an Easter egg in Dead Talents Society, and there are also a lot of actors in the film that did voice-overs for our animation, so it’s kind of like a reunion. Is there anything particular about World of Warcraft that spoke to your comedic tastes? This definitely was practice for me, to get used to genre storytelling, because as a Taiwanese filmmaker, we didn’t really have that much opportunity to practice on different kinds of genres. Like action films — car chases or big-budget fights. And it gave us a lot of exercise in terms of the timing of the comedy. You’re also known for the 2019 adaptation of the video game Detention, but you’ve said in interviews that you felt constrained on that one because it had to be a very serious movie compared with what you’re doing here. It was originally a Taiwanese video game. Since I’m such a huge gamer — they realized it might be a good idea to have someone who’s familiar with gaming culture make that film. It’s not that I’m particularly interested in horror or history, but it’s because of the fact that I’m a gamer that I got that job. But most of my short films before that, and Dead Talents Society — what I mostly do is comedies or satire. Did you learn useful things from Detention? Yeah, because it was my first feature, and the production was so huge — I was totally blown away by how complicated it is to make a feature film. But at the same time, it also gave me some flexibility. I knew Dead Talents Society would be more personal to me and the actors, so it was nice to have this kind of experience first. There are so many satirical elements in Dead Talents Society, mocking reality competition shows and Asian horror cinema, awards shows and social media and stunt streamers and idol pop. Did you spend a lot of time studying all this different media to get the tone and the elements right? Not intentionally. We grew up with all this stuff. It’s our childhood. We grew up with the pop culture phenomenon back in the ’90s in Taiwan. [With the satirical pop idol video in the movie], there were a lot of male and female idols doing exactly the same thing. When you watch those music videos now, you might feel a little bit awkward, but they’re iconic for that period of time. And since the theme of our film is about being seen, throughout different times and in different ways, and What are you willing to do or sacrifice in terms of being seen?, being able to combine different methods or media where characters could be seen was important. Because they’re dead, they’re ghosts, they can be coming from different eras. For Catherine, it was probably the ’70 or ’80s when she died, and television was the most important stage for someone who wants to become famous, wants to be seen. But Jessica died at the beginning of the internet. And for Makoto and the new girl, it’s the influencer era, the rise of influencers. So [the mechanics of fame] are all kind of different, but they’re all talking about the same thing: How media affects our own value, and we build our identities around other people’s opinions. It’s all the same topic, but from different angles. That’s why we have so many different kinds of media put together. You have talked in the past about having to study influencer culture to understand it, because you didn’t grow up with it like you did with pop videos or TV. Well, we couldn’t interview ghosts, so we just interviewed influencers. What did you learn about influencer culture that surprised you? The same situation [about seeking fame] got worse with influencers, because they need to make a video weekly, or even sometimes daily, to get views. They always need to come up with new ideas, too. And it can be such a toxic thing for one’s mentality. I’ve been watching documentaries about influencers, and you can tell they’re all suffering from some kind of burnout that’s really harmful for their identities. I remember there was one Taiwanese influencer who always got views from doing stupid stuff. He’s in jail now. He was like the Taiwanese Logan Paul, always doing really stupid stuff. For example, he would drink his own piss for a video. If you drink your piss, what are you going to do next to top the views, to get more views? It’s like a curse that’s never going to end. In the documentary [I watched], you can tell he’s actually quite normal. The crazy side is just a persona. But in order to get more views, he would put on that persona and do stupid stuff. And I feel like that’s really sad. In that documentary, there are also scenes from his partner saying he was suicidal. [And now he’s in jail] because he was selling some kind of AI-generated porn of celebrities. It’s crazy. I can see how that works into the film, as the characters put on wild, over-the-top personas in order to land as urban legends, but they’re constantly chasing novelty and trying to be outrageous and extreme. I caught some of the references, like the Perfect Blue dress or the Ringu-style hair-in-the-face ghost, but I kept wondering if there were other similarly specific gags I was missing. There are a lot! The girl in the red riding hood is an urban legend in Taiwan, probably the most popular urban legend in Taiwan. They made a series of films about her. So she’s really the biggest star in terms of the ghost world. There’s a series of horror films about urban legends — there’s a movie about the yellow raincoat guys releasing this year. What about Catherine, the hotel ghost? The backstory behind the leading actors are fictional, or referencing certain subgenres of horror. For example, Jessica is a representative of spirits that use technology to scare people — The Ring or One Missed Call, something like that. But [all the background] ghost characters are actually Taiwanese urban legends, every one of them. So we did some research with a book called The Taiwanese Urban Legend Encyclopedia. It’s like a record of every Taiwanese ghost story. So whenever we needed a side character, we would just flip the pages and see what was in it. How did you get to the Perfect Blue costume reference? It was actually quite late in the production. When we decided on Jessica’s character, even if we don’t have the time for the backstory [in the movie], we did have our setup: She might be someone who wanted to become a star or an idol in the early 2000s and she was accidentally killed during an audition. So our costume designer gave this one of the options for her. She was presenting four or five different costumes for me, and asked me to choose one of them. And I immediately recognized that dress from Perfect Blue. I was like, “Are you kidding me? Are you seriously putting that as one of your options?” And she was saying, “But you like it, right?” I was like, “Yeah, I love Kon Satoshi. He’s one of my biggest inspirations. So yeah, why not?” And thematically, it’s also quite similar — Perfect Blue is also about the price you have to pay in order to be seen. Is there anything you feel you’ve taken from his work or learned from his work? The tempo of his films is really fast. I really enjoy his fast-paced storytelling methods. I also admire how he constructs characters. In Tokyo Godfathers, he has three homeless losers, but they become a found family. I’m a sucker for those stories. And we did have this in Dead Talents Society, too — they’re also a bunch of losers. And they’re trying so hard to do something that’s actually super stupid, but at the same time, it’s so important to them. When we came up with the idea of having all five of them dressing up in sailor uniforms and chasing those influencers, even though they know it’s going to be in vain — that kind of reminded me of the climax of Tokyo Godfathers and Little Miss Sunshine at the same time. Dead Talents Society is streaming on Netflix now. Detention is streaming for free with ads on Tubi and Amazon Video and is available for rental or purchase on Apple TV and other digital platforms.

    "full_content": "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he plans to impose additional tariffs on the European Union and Canada if they work together to do \"economic harm\" to the US. \"If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday morning. Trump's remarks come just after he signed an executive order to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports on Wednesday, which will likely affect European carmakers. Since returning to office in January, Trump has also introduced sweeping 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. His administration has placed a 25% tariff on almost all imports from Canada and Mexico and raised tariffs to 20% for China. Canada announced in early March that it was retaliating with a 25% tariff on $155 billion of American goods. In March, freshly sworn-in Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney chose to make his first overseas visits to France and the UK instead of the US. During his trip to France earlier this month, Carney called Canada the \"most European of non-European countries.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The threat of tariffs comes as Washington's relations with its European allies already face strain from Trump's public position on defense cooperation. The president has repeatedly raised doubts about US commitments to defending Europe, saying that its countries were taking advantage of the US and not pulling their weight. \"It's common sense, right?\" Trump told reporters earlier this month. \"If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them.\" Europe heavily relies on the US military, which stations key bases throughout the continent, while many of the continent's armed forces buy advanced American weapons. Several key capabilities, such as Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II, form the pillars of many European militaries and depend on American parts and maintenance workers. Leaders in several countries, such as Portugal and Denmark, have expressed concerns about that exposure, indicating they may no longer view the F-35 as the best option for their countries. Canada's defense minister has also signaled similar apprehension, saying Ottawa was looking at \"other alternatives\" after Trump commented that Canada could be the 51st US state. The fate of the aircraft's foreign sales could belie a larger shift in Europe's long-standing trust in the American system — once thought to be a near-impregnable relationship in the post-World War II era. The rest of the European Union, largely in response to Trump's rhetoric, has proposed a plan to massively increase domestic defense spending by $840 billion in an \"era of rearmament.\"",

Otherwise, you could be paying an arm and a leg more for the exact same products now that Trump’s trade tariffs have been put in place. I’d like to clarify that this article is merely for information, here at DIYP we are staying politically neutral. Please keep any comments friendly and free from political diatribes, as I’m sure most of our lovely readers usually do 😉 For anyone who’s been living off-grid or under a rock for the past week, let’s just go over what these tariffs are. Last week, President Trump announced new trade tariffs that will be implemented on imports from other countries into the USA. The rest of the world has spent the week reeling from the news due to the unprecedented high rates. The move is to promote America-made manufacturing and products. However, in reality, the effects are more complicated. These tariffs are essentially an import tax and are to be paid by the importer when the goods enter the USA. Obviously, these taxes will be passed onto the consumer so that the business importing items can maintain their usual profit margin (although many will likely take a hit too). If you want a detailed economic breakdown, then there are several good sources; however, in basic terms, this means that prices will likely rise for the average American consumer. This includes camera equipment.  These countries are to have the following tariffs placed on them: “All well and good,” you might think. “We need jobs and industry in America, and America first isn’t a bad stance.” But let’s take a quick look at where most camera equipment is manufactured (hint: it’s mostly not in the USA). Mirrorless Rumours helpfully published a list of the locations where most camera products are manufactured. First, let’s look at the ones based in the USA. These would be RED cine cameras (although now that Nikon owns them that could change) and some Blackmagic products (although Blackmagic is actually Australian-owned). Additionally, some specialist scientific, military, and industrial cameras are made in the US, such as FLIR, Teledyne DALSA, and Vision Research, which produce high-speed, thermal, or industrial-grade cameras. You’ll notice that all of these cameras are pretty specialised (either for cinema or research) and do not include any of the major camera brands. Here’s where those household names are manufactured: As you can see, the majority of the world’s cameras are manufactured in a small concentration of countries. These same countries are set to be hit by between 20 and 46% of import tariffs, if they go ahead as stated last week by President Trump. Sony Alpha Rumours published a worst-case scenario table of potential camera prices after the tariffs were applied. A Canon R5 Mark II, which currently sells for $3,999, could end up costing $4,958.76 after the 24% tariff is applied. Similarly, an already costly Leica M11 manufactured in Germany will end up costing $10,794.00 rather than the previous $8,995. Remember that this will also apply to lenses, film stocks, lighting gear, bags, and other accessories manufactured outside of the US. Ordinarily, tariffs are applied to protect the manufacturing interests of the country applying them in the hope that they will force companies to open manufacturing bases in the US. However, the short-term outlook is that this is incredibly difficult and costly to implement and is not a viable short-term solution if there is no infrastructure already in place. Not to mention, the labour costs are drastically higher in the USA than in Vietnam, for example. However, the good news is that the camera brands do value their not-insignificant US customer base and likely don’t want to lose those sales. DJI recently confirmed to DCW that “Tariffs are one of several factors that we consider in our comprehensive pricing strategy (…) Our commitment to closely monitoring relevant policies and economic indicators is unwavering, as is our dedication to providing high-quality products at the best possible price.” There are rumours that these tariffs will be re-negotiated, so we mustn’t panic and assume that the world will spiral into an economic depression. However, it is likely that camera prices will increase. My stab-in-the-dark guess is that prices will increase globally, not just in the USA, to keep markets somewhat stable in a global industry and additionally to discourage black-market trading. Another possible outcome is that the camera brands will delay launching new products, particularly if there is a threat of an economic downturn. Similarly, the second-hand camera gear market is likely to be affected too, as it reacts to supply and demand, so expect eBay and MPB deals to be more pricey as well. Our advice would be to buy any gear you’re considering now, while current stocks last (although even those could end up with an anticipatory increase in price).

Why should they Vietnam come begging?  They are a country with a GDP 1/70th the US. They buy a far higher percentage of their GDP from the US than the US buys from them. The US had a shooting war with Vietnam just 50 years ago.  Launching a trade war with them and other countries does not endure us to them. In the long run they will look for other security, trading and political partners. *Download requires newsletter signup",

    "full_content": "A confidential Pentagon document suggests the United States may not come to Europe's aid in the event of a Russian attack. The leaked internal memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose staggering 'lies' were exposed this week, is said to prioritise deterring China's ambitions over Taiwan and bolstering defense measures on U.S. soil.  According to The Washington Post, parts of the memo are strikingly similar to a publication by a conservative think tank involved with Project 2025, with sections mirroring it word for word. It comes amid another Hegseth scandal over his tattoo and a panicked phone call from Trump over Elon Musk.  The memo outlines Hegseth's stance that America is unlikely to offer significant support to Europe against Russian aggression. It highlights an expectation for NATO allies to assume the primary role in defending their territory.  The United States, the guidance suggests, will provide nuclear deterrence against Russia but will only commit forces that are not essential for homeland security or missions related to China. The document underscores the importance of increased defense contributions from European nations, stating that this \"will also ensure NATO can reliably deter or defeat Russian aggression even if deterrence fails and the United States is already engaged in, or must withhold forces to deter, a primary conflict in another region.\" The latest memo aligns the Pentagon's strategy with President Trump's global security concerns, particularly highlighting undefined threats from the \"near abroad\". In the document, Trump insists that U.S. forces must be \"ready to defend American interests wherever they might be threatened in our hemisphere, from Greenland, to the Panama Canal, to Cape Horn.\" On Friday, March 28, Trump's declaration \"we have to have Greenland\" ramped up tensions with Denmark, a NATO ally responsible for the autonomous island's foreign affairs and defence. The interim guidance spans nine pages and bears striking resemblances to a more extensive report set for 2024 by the Heritage Foundation, with several sections appearing almost verbatim when compared by The Washington Post. The Heritage Foundation has not responded to The Washington Post's request for a statement. It's been a bad week for Hegseth, who was embroiled in the Signal-gate text scandal.  Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, accused the Secretary of Defense of lying about sharing war plans in a Signal group chat.   Goldberg was accidentally added to this chat last month and released screenshots that contradict Hegseth's previous claims.   Hegseth had insisted that no war plans were discussed in the private group on the encrypted messaging platform. \"Nobody was texting war plans. And that's all I have to say about that,\" the former Fox News pundit stated when questioned by a reporter. He also claimed he had never met Goldberg.   The journalist addressed the issue in his latest column, saying: \"So, about that Signal chat.\" He continued, \"On Monday, shortly after we published a story about a massive Trump-administration security breach, a reporter asked the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, why he had shared plans about a forthcoming attack on Yemen on the Signal messaging app.\"  Hegseth denied discussing war plans, but Goldberg's screenshots suggest otherwise, showing Hegseth detailing the day's events.",

Taiwan competes at most international sports events as Chinese Taipei to avoid objections from neighbours China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own territory. However, Taiwan's government rejects China's sovereignty claims. The Taiwan flag was displayed on a video screen behind Li Yu-Hsiang when the skater was introduced ahead of the short program in Boston, Massachusetts on Thursday. A public address announcer at the venue read out the International Skating Union's (ISU) apology ahead of the pairs event later in the day. \"The ISU would like to sincerely apologise for the display of the incorrect flag for Chinese Taipei during the ISU World Figure Skating Championships event today,\" it  said. \"We fully understand the sensitivity of this mistake and deeply regret any offence or confusion this may have caused.\" Li failed to qualify for the finals in the short program event after finishing 30th.",

    "full_content": "British luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover is halting shipments of its cars to the US this month as it navigates President Donald Trump's new 25% tariff on imported automobiles. In a statement Saturday, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider: \"The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.\" The Times of London first reported the pause. JLR said in a separate statement on Wednesday that its brands were \"accustomed to changing market conditions\" and that it was prioritizing \"delivering for our clients around the world and addressing these new US trading terms.\" The company, which employs almost 40,000 people across the world, is one of the UK's most iconic carmakers and has long been popular with celebrities in both Britain and the US. JLR's retail sales were up 21.7% to just over 430,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2023 to 2024, including roughly 95,000 in North America, according to its annual report. JLR's decision to pause US shipments follows a massive global stock market sell-off sparked by Trump's slew of new tariffs, which he announced this week. A baseline 10% tariff on trading partners came into effect on Saturday, while higher levies on some nations are set to begin on April 9. While Trump sees the duties as a means of bolstering domestic investment and \"supercharging\" the economy, many analysts are questioning the potential economic consequences.",

    "full_content": "Self-ruled island ‘strongly’ condemns Chinese actions, says it deployed military vessels and aircraft to monitor the drills. China holds large-scale military drills around Taiwan China has launched a new round of military exercises around Taiwan in its latest “warning” to the island’s democratic government. The Chinese military said on Tuesday that the drills served as a “powerful deterrent” to “separatist forces” advocating Taiwanese independence. The exercises are intended to test the “combat readiness” of China’s army, navy, air force, and rocket force, and their ability to work together during a joint military operation, the Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. The drills were being carried out from multiple directions around Taiwan and focused on “sea and air combat readiness patrols, seizing comprehensive control, sea and land strikes, and blocking key areas and roads”, the command added. Taiwan’s Presidential Office said it “strongly condemned” China’s actions, while its Defence Ministry announced it had deployed military vessels and aircraft to monitor the drills. China considers Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, part of its territory and has pledged to take control of the island by force if necessary. Wen-ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said the military exercises appeared to be focused on containing and isolating Taiwan. “One of the scenarios that analysts have always been concerned about is the prospect of the Chinese military launching a quarantine or an embargo against waterways near Taiwan and how that may enable the PLA to squeeze Taiwan and starve Taiwan and thereby force it into submission,” Sung told Al Jazeera, using the acronym for the official name of China’s People’s Liberation Army. “This time around, that very manoeuvre of quarantine of key passageways around Taiwan is one of the main items on the PLA to-do list.” The Chinese Communist Party views Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te and his Democratic Progressive Party as “separatists”, and has staged military exercises with increasing frequency in response to their activities. In its announcement of the drills, the PLA released a short animation describing Lai as a “parasite poisoning Taiwan” while depicting the Taiwanese leader being held to a fire with a set of chopsticks.      During a regular news briefing later on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said efforts towards Taiwan independence were not going to succeed. “[Taiwan] authorities’ stubborn persistence with the Taiwan independence stance and their futile attempt to split the country from outside by seeking independence is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot; it is doomed to fail,”  told a regular briefing. The latest round of military exercises comes after Lai last month called Beijing a “foreign hostile force” and laid out a 17-point plan to curtail its ongoing political infiltration, espionage and influence operations in Taiwan. On Monday, Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office accused Lai of stirring up “anti-China sentiment” and intensifying tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Despite the uptick in military exercises, Sung said Lai’s “cross-Strait policy towards China enjoys majority support in Taiwan”, and Beijing’s responses to his actions are seen as “regrettable”. In an opinion poll released by the Taiwanese website My Formosa last month, 57 percent of respondents said they had trust in Lai and 56 percent said they approved of his job performance, up 6 points and 7 percentage points, respectively, from the previous poll. The website linked the uptick in Lai’s support to his speech taking aim at Beijing. China last held military exercises near Taiwan in December, after Lai made visits to three Pacific island states, the US state of Hawaii, and the US territory of Guam. China held bigger drills in May and October 2024 to coincide with Lai’s inauguration and Taiwan’s national day, respectively. Beijing has stepped up its use of military drills since August 2022, when the then-speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, became the highest-ranking US official to visit the island in a quarter century.",

    "full_content": "Beer, famously good for your hair, so why not for your face too? Well, Heineken’s Smootheriser makes the case that beer for the belly is good enough for the hair, and can be great for the face too. Developed in-house and launching in Taiwan and Cambodia, the Smootheriser uses the same quality hops and barley as its alcoholic counterpart – but instead of working your liver, it hydrates your skin. What first started as an April Fool’s Joke actually spun off into a full-fledged product development exercise. I’m not kidding – Heineken’s own press release says “This isn’t an April Fool’s Joke.” The Heineken® Smootheriser will launch in Cambodia and Taiwan, coinciding with the beverage company’s marketing of Heineken Silver – its premium beer offering. I guess (facial) beauty really is in the eyes of the beer holder. Designer: Heineken \n\n\n\n\n It’s not entirely clear if the skin cream will be a limited-edition offering or something Heineken will develop continually for the near future – but the cream is a way of drawing attention to Heineken Silver – one of the company’s most popular beers. Brewed at -1°C for its signature crisp taste, Heineken Silver has a fairly large fan-base… and if the company can also get the same people to keep their skin looking flawlessly moisturized, I guess that’s a win for everyone. The launch in Asia hopes to tap into the massive skincare-enthusiast market in the region, providing a premium product made using the same high-quality ingredients as their beer.  Heineken obviously gets the fact that announcing this on the first of April comes with its level of extra skepticism. I went through the press release multiple times too – but I guess you have to take a company on its word when it does specify it in a press release. After all, sometimes jokes can have a pretty adverse impact on a company’s valuation in the stock market – remember Volkswagen teasing that they were rebranding to Voltswagen? The Smootheriser, arguably, feels much better-planned. It’s sure to make people laugh, then become actually curious, and hopefully relent. Maybe Heineken should launch a beer-flavored Lip Gloss next?! \n\n\n\n\n I’ve always envied people with tattoos—the commitment, the clarity, the sheer audacity of saying, “Yes, I want this specific thing on my body forever.” Me?… Meet the Dynamic Folio – a case from the folks at MOFT that elevates your iPad.

    "full_content": "The case marks a first for Taiwan in prosecuting what it alleged is deliberate damage to a subsea cable. Taiwanese prosecutors have formally charged the captain of a Chinese-crewed cargo ship that Taipei says severed one of its subsea cables earlier this year. The Togo-flagged Hong Tai 58 was detained by Taiwan’s coastguard in February near the site of a cable breakdown amid allegations that it had deliberately dropped its anchor to cause damage. The ship’s captain, who was only identified to the public by his surname Wang, was charged on Friday with being responsible for the incident, the prosecutors said. Seven Chinese nationals who were on board the ship will not be charged, and will be transported back to China, the prosecutors added. The case marks a first for Taiwan, where subsea cables have become the latest front in what is described as “hybrid warfare” or “grey zone activity” with China. The terms refer to low-grade coercive acts such as sabotage that hold a certain degree of plausible deniability. China has long claimed Taiwan, an island with a population of 23 million, as a province of the mainland and has threatened to annex it by force, if necessary. China has yet to reply to the charges against Wang, but it has previously accused Taipei of “manipulating” the facts of the accident to cast Beijing in a bad light.      Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, previously described the subsea cable incident as a “common maritime accident”. Wang declined to provide Taiwanese authorities with information about the ship’s ownership, according to prosecutors, but the Hong Tai 58 is believed to be a so-called Chinese “dark ship” acting unofficially on behalf of Beijing. “Dark ships” have earned their name due to the practice of broadcasting multiple or false identities to maritime authorities. Sometimes the vessels may turn off identification signals to avoid detection, according to industry experts. Since 2023, there have been at least 11 cases of subsea cable breakdowns around Taiwan, although some were later ruled as accidents or due to the old age of the equipment. Subsea cables are the backbone of the internet and global telecoms industry, but they are also susceptible to breakdowns from movements on the sea floor or human activity. Between 100 and 200 cable breakdowns occur each year, according to industry data, and proving damage as deliberate is notoriously difficult and a challenge for governments beyond Taipei. Countries around the Baltic Sea have also seen an uptick in subsea cable breakdowns since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and they have also struggled to bring legal cases against Chinese and Russia-linked ships and their owners.",

    "full_content": "After a tidal wave of rumors and leaks, the Google Pixel 9a saw an official announcement earlier this month — and now we know it will be available for purchase on April 10 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. On April 14, the Pixel 9a will make its way to an additional 23 European countries, before finally arriving in India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia on April 16. This midrange budget handset will start at $499 for the 128GB model, with a bump up to $599 for the 256GB model. It has a 6.3-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, paired with a maximum brightness of 2700 nits. That means you’ll be able to use it in direct sunlight without worrying about visibility. All models come with 8GB of RAM, regardless of the amount of storage. That’s more than enough to power a slew of different Android and Google Play games, as well as Gemini AI features. The Google Pixel 9a ships with Android 15 and supports seven major Android upgrades throughout its lifespan. As far as cameras go, it has a 48MP wide angle lens and a 12MP ultrawide angle lens, along with a 13MP ultrawide selfie cam. The phone can record 1080p video up to 240 frames per second, or up to 60 frames per second at 4K. A 5,100mAh battery will keep you going throughout the day, and 23W wired charging (along with 7.5W wireless charging) will help you top off your charge when it starts to run low. While the Google Pixel 9a might not be a flagship, it’s no slouch, either. It’s a solid midrange competitor that can go toe to toe with many lower-end flagships without breaking a sweat, and it’s a great option for someone that wants to test out the Pixel ecosystem without spending a fortune on one of the frontrunners — or settling for an older, outdated model.",

CNBC's reporters covered the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Read CNBC's continued coverage of Trump's historic tariff plan here. The weekend is looking like a breeze for Trump — if not for stock market investors hammered by the fallout from his new tariffs. The White House posted a tweet showing Trump walking with his hair, tie and suit jacket blown back from the wind, with the italicized message, \"Almost Friday.\" The tweet's jaunty vibe contrasted with a metaphorical bloodbath on Wall Street, where the major stock indices all suffered big drops. Nissan Motor's luxury Infiniti brand has indefinitely paused production of two Mexico-built crossovers for the U.S. in response to the newly imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles by Trump. In a memo to the brand's retailers, Infiniti Americas Vice President Tiago Castro said QX50 and QX55 output for the U.S. is halted \"until further notice\" due to the tariffs, Automotive News reported Thursday. A company spokesman confirmed the actions Thursday afternoon to CNBC and said the Japanese automaker is reviewing its \"production and supply chain operations to identify optimal solutions for efficiency and sustainability.\" \"We will continue to evaluate the impact, as well as market needs, to make any additional adjustments to production,\" Nissan said in an emailed statement. Separately, Nissan on Thursday confirmed it will maintain two shifts of production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant that is free of the new auto tariffs. Nissan had planned to scale back Rogue production in Smyrna to a single shift starting this month. The European Union and Switzerland, two crucial markets for luxury goods, were hit with tariffs of 20% and 31%, respectively. Compared with their luxury peers, Swiss watchmakers stand to be most affected, JPMorgan analysts said in a note.  Analysts highlighted Swiss conglomerates Swatch Group, which counts Omega among its brands, and Richemont, owner of Piaget, noting their thin margins. The Swatch Group fell nearly 4% and shares of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA dropped 6.3% in trading. Gucci owner Kering and Burberry are also vulnerable, according to the analysts, citing weak profits and \"less pricing power to mitigate some of the impact given their currently softer brand momentum.\" Kering and Burberry shares fell 7.5% and 9.2%, respectively. As for luxury powerhouse LVMH, analysts estimated its wine and spirits division, which includes cognac brand Hennessy, would be most negatively affected.  Hermès faces the least damage before mitigation, estimated at roughly 3% to 5% by JPMorgan. Analysts said Hermès has less reliance on U.S. sales, high profitability and strong pricing power. LVMH ended down more than 3%. Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that Hermes is a separate, publicly traded company. After multiple White House aides insisted that the new tariffs were not a negotiation, Trump said he would be open to negotiating with other countries about the duties. Trump said he would be open to tariff talks with other counties if they offer something phenomenal, Reuters reported him saying on Air Force One. Top trade aide Peter Navarro told CNBC less than an hour earlier that the sweeping tariffs are \"not a negotiation.\" Some big names in the market took the brunt of the punishment on Thursday, with Apple and Nike among the iconic American companies contributing in a major way to the S&P 500's worst day since 2020. But the tariff wall that Trump is building around the U.S. is estimated at nearly $1 trillion, according to data shared with CNBC by Trade Partnership Worldwide. They will have profound consequences throughout the market and global supply chain, across each American state and into the lives of every consumer. Trade experts are skeptical that negotiations will result in quick deals. Any manufacturing renaissance in the U.S. will come much later than an acute manufacturing crisis, experts told CNBC. U.S. CEOs, especially those in critical industries such as medical devices, are headed to Capitol Hill to plead their case. In a nutshell, it \"isn't good news for the global economy,\" as shipping giant Maersk put it. Read the full story: Trump's other wall: $1 trillion in tariffs wrapped around U.S. economy— Lori Ann LaRocco Top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro denied that Trump's new tariffs are being used as a tool to negotiate better trade terms with other countries. \"This is not a negotiation,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime.\" \"This is not that. This is a national emergency,\" he said. The newly imposed tariffs pose a drag on growth, said Lindsay Rosner, Goldman Sachs head of multi-asset fixed income. The only question is how much. The extent of the drag will depend on several factors, such as other countries imposing retaliatory tariffs and the Trump administration's willingness to negotiate, Rosner told journalists at a conference at Goldman Sachs' Manhattan headquarters. She also noted that sectors and companies will not be equally affected by the tariffs. Rosner is also waiting to see how the Federal Reserve responds. \"They've got to push back here because I think the big word of 'stagflation' is real here,\" she said.  Stagflation occurs when inflation rises as economic growth slows. Finally, Rosner said she believes Wednesday's tariffs were just the beginning and wonders what the Trump administration will impose next. \"I think we all know there is more to come,\" she said. Shares in top U.S. exporter Boeing tumbled 10% and other aerospace stocks such as engine maker GE Aerospace also fell, as companies assessed tariff effects on their global supply chains. GE has a joint venture with France's Safran, and together they provide parts and build best-selling engines under their shared CFM brand. Those engines power Boeing and Airbus narrow-body planes. Aircraft are made with thousands of parts from all across the world. Even European plane maker Airbus, which has expanded its final assembly lines in Mobile, Alabama, over the past decade, relies on components made outside the U.S. Boeing, which assembles its 787 Dreamliner jets in South Carolina, has a supply chain spanning from Japan to Italy. \"There are still a lot of unknowns, such as how they are applied to aerospace, which tier of suppliers or customers will pay for them, and how trading partners will respond,\" Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote Thursday. She noted that aircraft and defense products boost U.S. exports and have been \"insulated via The Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, but raw [material] price inflation is unavoidable.\" Household staples such as coffee, bananas and toilet paper will likely get more expensive as the Trump administration's tariffs go into effect. The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group that represents Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and other consumer giants, is asking for exemptions for key ingredients and inputs that cannot be produced at scale in the U.S. As an example, the CBA pointed to the fact that the U.S. climate limits domestic production of tropical fruits, coffee and spices. The countries that do produce those goods, such as Guatemala and Madagascar, have been slapped with tariffs that range from 10% to 47%. Manufacturers and retailers will likely pass on the higher ingredient costs to shoppers. Inedible staples, such as toilet paper and shampoo, could become more expensive, too, due to higher costs for inputs such as wood pulp and palm oil, the CBA said. Federal Reserve officials could get caught in a policy box if tariffs spike inflation and weaken growth, diminishing the chances of an interest rate cut anytime soon. A general consensus emerged on Wall Street that unless the announced duties are negotiated down, core inflation this year likely will run north of 3%, and economic growth could be flat or negative as unemployment rises. In that case, the Fed would find itself torn between its \"dual mandate\" of full employment and low inflation. \"The problem for the Fed is that they're going to have to be very, be very reactive,\" said Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS. U.S. markets continue to fall as investors digest news of Trump's far-reaching tariffs. The selling has been accelerating into the close of trading at 4 p.m. ET. Read CNBC's full market coverage here. The formula used by the White House to determine its sweeping tariff policy looks like it could have come from artificial intelligence chatbots, according to The Verge, which on Thursday used some quick work done by journalist James Surowiecki and some commenters on X. Surowiecki wrote on X that it appears as if the Trump administration \"just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's exports to us.\" The Verge said its reporters got similar results when they asked popular AI chatbots — including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok — for \"easy\" ways to solve trade deficits or to put the U.S. on an \"even playing field\" with other countries.  The four bots gave \"the same fundamental suggestion,\" the Verge said, though some of the details provided by each one differed. Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson warned companies against price fixing in light of tariffs. The FTC \"will be watching closely to make sure American companies are vigorously competing on prices,\" he said in a post on social media site X. \"These necessary tariffs should not be interpreted as a green light for price fixing or any other unlawful behavior,\" Ferguson wrote. \"We will always protect American consumers.\" Trump said the response to his staggering new tariff plan is \"going very well.\" \"The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,\" he told reporters as he departed the White House. \"The rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?\" he said. Trump pointed to investment pledges that some companies have made in recent weeks, claiming that it totals almost $7 trillion. \"You'll see how it's going to turn out. Our country is going to boom,\" he said. Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said Thursday that Trump's tariff plan was more drastic than administration officials had signaled and will prove damaging if it is not scaled back. Speaking on CNBC's \"Halftime Report,\" he said major business leaders in the U.S. share that opinion. \"I talked to probably 10 CEOs who are all in the Business Roundtable — these are CEOs of the largest companies in America — overnight, and [they all] think this is a huge mistake. They think this is too much, that it will have lasting and cascading negative repercussions for the United States and the global economy,\" Gerstner said. Gerstner did not specify who spoke with him, but the members of the Business Roundtable include the CEOs of the biggest companies from multiple industries, including firms such as Apple, Bank of America, Boeing and FedEx. Gerstner, who generally focuses on the technology sector as an investor, said Trump's tariff plan \"looks like protectionism\" as opposed to a step toward more equitable global trade. Trump is set to depart the White House and head to his Doral Golf Club in Miami, where he will attend a dinner for LIV, the pro golf tour that has previously held tournaments at Trump's properties. After the event, Trump will fly to his Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, according to the White House. Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said chipmaker Nvidia is positioned to weather Trump's broad tariffs. Nvidia produces the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that power the artificial intelligence boom. The company may be better positioned to withstand the effect of tariffs because semiconductors, like GPUs, are on the list of exceptions — what Gerstner called a \"wise exception.\" \"The growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,\" he told CNBC's \"Fast Money Halftime Report.\" Gerstner said he is concerned about the potential for a recession due to Trump's tariffs but is relatively bullish on Nvidia, saying the \"negative impact from tariffs will be much less than in other areas.\" The new wave of tariffs could have drastically different effects on the two leading U.S. dollar-store chains. Dollar Tree's stock dropped more than 10%, declining along with shares of other retailers that rely on manufacturing in China and Vietnam. But shares of rival Dollar General climbed more than 4%. Trump will slap an additional 34% tariff on imports from China, bringing new duties implemented on the nation's goods during his second term to 54%. That is worse news for Dollar Tree because according to a note from UBS analysts this week, the company's exposure to China is about 32% of its cost of goods sold. Dollar General only has about 4% exposure. During an earnings call last month, Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said the company could hike prices to help offset tariffs. LinkedIn co-founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman criticized Trump's tariffs policy, writing in a post on social media site X, \"This is a long game to hurt everyday Americans and consolidate power at the top.\" Hoffman is a major Democratic donor and was an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris during her presidential run. He has frequently criticized the Trump administration and previously expressed concern that Trump could retaliate against business leaders who did not back him. In his post Thursday, Hoffman said the Trump administration has eroded trust in U.S. markets, \"first with crypto grifts\" and now with tariff policies \"drafted by a team that can't even do basic mathematics.\" Small-cap stocks have entered bear market territory as markets reel in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. Watch CNBC's market blog for all the key updates as they happen. General Motors plans to temporarily increase pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana as the auto industry adjusts to Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. GM confirmed the plans without mentioning tariffs: \"General Motors will be making operational adjustments at Fort Wayne Assembly, including hiring temporary employees, to support current manufacturing and business needs. We continuously update and revise production schedules as part of our standard process of evaluating and aligning to manage vehicle inventory.\" The increase in workers is in addition to the supplemental workers GM was already hiring to support summer breaks and time off for their regular employees, according to a person familiar with the plans. GM produces its crucial, highly profitable pickup trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra at various plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The Detroit automaker has not cut production at any plants as a result of the tariffs, like its crosstown rival Stellantis is doing, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak to media. American drinkers may be swapping out their Aperol spritzes for margaritas this summer. The Trump administration's 20% tariff on goods imported from the European Union will hit European wines, spirits and beer, Reuters reports. Mexican-imported canned beer such as Modelo, the best-selling beer in the U.S., will also face a new 25% tariff. Shares of Constellation Brands, which owns Mexican-brewed beers such as Modelo and Corona, are down less than 1% in afternoon trading. Investors have been anticipating the levies since Trump's election. But the tariffs were not as harsh as the 200% duties Trump threatened on European wine, Champagne and spirits last month. The president also held off on imposing the 25% tariffs on Mexican tequila and Canadian whisky, lifting shares of Campari, Heineken and Diageo higher. Matt Mittelsteadt, a tech policy research fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that the new tariffs \"directly threaten American AI. These massive tax hikes are slamming during the exact window U.S. industry has to set the global standard — risking innovation and ceding the market.\" Shares of CoreWeave, which recently became the first pure-play artificial intelligence company to IPO, were down more than 17% on Thursday. Nvidia stock was down nearly 7%, while shares of Microsoft and Google were both down more than 2%. Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman encouraged foreign leaders to reach out to Trump \"immediately\" to negotiate, according to a post on social media site X on Thursday. Ackman endorsed Trump in the 2024 election and has been a vocal supporter of the president on social media. In his post Thursday, he described Trump as a \"dealmaker\" and a \"tough, but fair negotiator\" who thinks about the world as a series of transactions. \"I expect Trump will reward the early dealmakers with fairer deals than those that wait to sit down at the negotiating table,\" Ackman wrote. \"Countries that respond with additional tariffs on our goods will be severely punished. The carrot and the stick writ large, Big Boy style.\" Canada will impose 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S., Prime Minister Mark Carney announced, matching Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles that took effect today. The tariffs will only apply to autos that are not compliant with the USMCA, the North American free trade agreement, Carney said. He said the tariffs will not affect auto parts or vehicle content from Mexico. \"We know the benefits of our integrated production system,\" Carney said. He added that Canada is \"developing a framework for auto producers to avoid our counter tariffs, as long as they maintain their production and investment in Canada.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump \"is not going to back off\" his newly announced tariffs. \"I don't think there's any chance\" that Trump will reverse course, Lutnick said in a CNN interview. \"This is the reordering of global trade, right? That's what's going to happen,\" he said. Asked to clarify, Lutnick said, \"the president is not going to back off.\" But, he added, \"countries can fix their tariffs, their non-tariff trade barriers, which are much, much rougher.\" The comments came as some Trump allies have expressed hope that the sweeping tariffs are negotiating tools to secure better trade relationships, rather than permanent import taxes. Trump's tariffs have boxed in retailers — and jeweler Pandora is not immune. The Danish company said it expects an annual hit of 1.2 billion crowns, or roughly $178 million, from the new duties on U.S. imports, before it takes any steps to mitigate the effects. For 2025, it expects a hit of 700 million crowns, or about $103 million. Pandora said it could raise prices or change its supply chain to help offset the levies. The jeweler said U.S. tariffs of 36% on imports from Thailand will have the biggest effect on its business. Pandora said it made 92% of its jewelry at facilities in Thailand as of last year. A bipartisan bill introduced to the Senate seeks to require that Congress approve tariffs if they are to continue 60 days after their implementation, NBC News reported. The bill also would require the president to notify Congress within 24 hours of announcing new tariffs. \"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. It is not clear when or even if the bill will be voted on. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed back on the looming prospect of grocery prices suddenly rising as a result of Trump's new tariffs. \"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Lutnick said on CNN when asked what he would tell Americans who voted for Trump and are about to face higher store prices. Lutnick said that when the U.S. opens the markets that he says are blocked by other countries, \"our volumes grow, our farmers will thrive, and the price of groceries will come down.\" \"Let Donald Trump run the global economy. He knows what he's doing,\" Lutnick said. Investors are seeking safety in fast-food chains, betting consumers will trade down to cheaper restaurant meals as tariffs weigh on their wallets. Shares of McDonald's, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International are up more than 1%, while other publicly traded restaurant companies' shares take a beating. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill and Texas Roadhouse are both down 3%. The two chains have reported stronger sales than the broader industry in recent quarters. Other eateries have seen even steeper declines in their share prices. Starbucks stock dropped 11%, Shake Shack's shares slid 13% and Sweetgreen's tumbled 16%. Typically, during economic downturns, fast-food chains report stronger sales than other restaurants, as price-sensitive consumers trade down from full-service dining and fast-casual lunches to less pricey combo meals at McDonald's or Burger King. The restaurant industry is already anticipating that the latest wave of tariffs will mean higher menu prices for diners. \"The biggest concerns for restaurant operators — from community restaurants to national brands — are that tariffs will hike food and packaging costs and add uncertainty to managing availability, while pushing prices up for consumers,\" the National Restaurant Association said in a statement. Shares of GE HealthCare, which manufactures medical imaging, ultrasound and other health devices, tumbled more than 10% on Thursday following Trump's tariff announcement. GE HealthCare produces its products in more than 20 countries and serves customers in more than 160 countries around the globe, according to its website. \"Our top priorities are to make sure patient and customer deliveries for products and services are not interrupted under any circumstances and at the best quality and cost possible,\" a GE HealthCare spokesperson told CNBC. \"This is a dynamic issue,\" the spokesperson noted. \"Our teams are working on potential mitigation plans as these trade policies evolve. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.\" Shares of Siemens Healthineers, a German med tech company, fell nearly 7% on Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Trump's aggressive and sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" affected more than 180 countries, from major trading partners to even tiny islands and remote locations. The tariff plan targeted numerous external Australian territories, including Heard and McDonald Islands, one of the most remote locations on earth, populated by seals and penguins. Norfolk Island, also an Australian territory with a population of nearly 2,000 people, was hit with some of the highest tariffs of 29%, despite Australia only facing 10% tariffs. \"I'm not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, according to The Guardian. Chipmaking stocks dropped Thursday as markets sold off after Trump revealed wide sweeping tariffs. Although the sector was excluded from the latest levies, duties targeting the sector are still coming. Semiconductors, which typically come to the U.S. in finished products such as personal computers, are also under pressure due to fears that tariffs will quell demand for technology gadgets and electronics. As of late morning trading, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF shed nearly 7%. Qorvo and Micron Technology plunged more than 12% each, while Qualcomm, Broadcom and Lam Research each dropped more than 7%. Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing slumped more than 6%, while Advanced Micro Devices fell about 5%. French President Emmanuel Macron urged companies in his country to pause investments in the U.S. after Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs. He said Trump's tariffs are a shock for international trade after his meeting at the Élysée Palace with representatives of industries affected by the heavy levies. Trump's plan sets a 10% baseline tariff across the board, while adding steep duties on many countries, including 34% on China and 20% on the European Union. Former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he believed \"the market can adjust\" to the new 10% baseline tariff on nearly all other countries, but hoped the larger tariff rates will be \"negotiated down.\" \"I do hope there's the ability to negotiate them down, because, as we've seen for certain businesses, it is going to take a long time to move that manufacturing base,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"And we've seen the stock market, particularly in certain stocks, react pretty negatively,\" he said. In another executive action signed Wednesday, Trump ended the so-called de minimis exemption on China and Hong Kong that allowed shipments worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. The trade loophole has helped Chinese cheap-goods manufacturers such as Temu and Shein flood the U.S. with inexpensive products. It will end May 2, according to the executive order. Trump had previously ended de minimis in early February but paused that move days later following concerns it could overwhelm U.S. Customs and Border Protection. On a brutal day for the stock market, shares of retailers — including Target and Nike — have been hammered particularly hard. Target, Nike, Wayfair, American Eagle Outfitters, Ugg and Hoka parent Deckers, as well as toymaker Hasbro all hit 52-week lows. Retailers are expected to face tough choices in the weeks and months ahead, as they manage higher costs from broad tariffs on imports from nations including China and Vietnam, which are major manufacturing hubs for shoes, clothing, toys, furniture and more. Some, such as Steve Madden, were slashing their sourcing from China in recent years and moving more production to other countries such as Vietnam. Yet, now, even imports from many of those alternative countries are subject to tariffs. Goods from Vietnam, for example, will face a 46% tariff. Some sectors of retail are particularly exposed: Nearly a third of footwear imports in the U.S. came from Vietnam in 2023, the most recent full-year data available, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, an industry trade group. Barclays retail analyst Seth Sigman said retailers will have a hard time absorbing all of the steep additional costs or sharing them with vendors. \"Unfortunately, some of it will result in higher prices,\" he said. CNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman and on-air editor Rick Santelli held an impromptu debate about the effect of Trump's tariffs on global trade. The spirited exchange on \"Squawk Box\" followed an appearance from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Stellantis is idling production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico due to tariffs. Roughly 900 U.S.-represented employees at supporting plants will be temporarily laid off in addition to roughly 4,500 hourly workers at the Canadian plant. Workers at the plant in Mexico will still report to the plant but will not produce vehicles due to their contract terms, according to a company spokeswoman. The downtime starts Monday and will last for two weeks at the automaker's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, and the entire month of April at its Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico. \"We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants,\" said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis North American chief. Vice President JD Vance argued that Trump's trade agenda, coupled with its deregulatory efforts and tax-cut plans, will ultimately bring down prices. But \"we're not going to fix things overnight,\" he said in a Fox News interview Thursday morning when asked if costs will go up and for how long. He framed the situation as one in which the Trump administration was tasked with fixing \"what was left to us\" by the Biden administration. \"You don't fix that stuff overnight. We know people are struggling. We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately,\" Vance said. Many economists warn that Trump's sweeping tariff policies will raise prices and lower growth, and even some administration officials have acknowledged the import duties will cause at least temporary economic disruption. Tariffs and economic uncertainty are threatening to slow construction of new hotels by driving up building-material costs, Baird's hotel analyst says. The cost to build in the U.S. could now be as much as 10% higher because of tariffs, particularly on materials that are largely imported from China and Vietnam, Baird hotel analyst Michael Bellisario wrote. Construction of new hotels was already strained compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic because of higher costs and interest rates. \"Signings and starts could slow over the near term given heightened macroeconomic and trade policy uncertainties; projects' opening dates are likely to slip as well, in our view,\" he said in his Thursday note, adding that Hilton, Marriott and Choice Hotels International are the most exposed to U.S. construction headwinds. Hotel stocks were all sharply lower in morning trading, and airline stocks, already battered this year, also fell. United was down more than 12% while American and Delta were each down more than 8%. Tariffs and economic weakness could add to both leisure and corporate bookings, while duties are set to drive up the cost of new aircraft. President Trump's son Eric Trump says the first countries to negotiate a trade deal with his father \"will win,\" as he warned the world not to be among the last nations to cut such a deal. \"I wouldn’t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,\" Eric wrote in a post on social media site X. \"The first to negotiate will win — the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life,\" he wrote. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" brushed aside the idea of countries winning exemptions from new tariffs on some products. \"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said. \"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick brushed aside the idea that some imports from certain countries will win exemptions from the new U.S. tariffs. \"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly,\" he said. Lutnick also said other countries would be making a mistake if they impose their own reciprocal tariffs on the U.S. in retaliation. \"I don't think it's effective in the world to retaliate,\" Lutnick said. \"I mean, those things are silly.\" New tariffs will raise the price of shoes that Americans buy and lead to cheaper-quality merchandise, says a major trade group. Trump's tariff policy \"is catastrophic for American families,\" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. The massive new import duties will hit footwear-producing nations such as Vietnam and China especially hard. \"Our industry is already dealing with inflationary pressures, and this move will force families to think twice before making a purchase,\" Priest said in a statement. The tariffs will \"drive-up costs, reduce product quality, and weaken consumer confidence,\" he added. Nearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group. About 37% of footwear imports came from China in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman wrote on social media site X, \"Sometimes the best strategy in a negotiation is convincing the other side that you are crazy.\" Ackman, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election, is a frequent defender of the president on social media. He argued in a prior X post Wednesday that other countries should not retaliate against the new U.S. tariffs. Citing a \"changing economy\" and its position as the No. 1 U.S. producer of cars and trucks, Ford said it is putting most of its vehicles on sale. The automaker is offering employee pricing to all U.S. customers from April 3 to June 2. The promotion excludes some large vehicles such as the Ford Raptor, the 2025 Expedition and Navigator SUVs and Super Duty trucks. \"We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans,\" the company said in a statement. \"We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.\" U.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in higher than expected as consumers flocked to buy cars ahead of auto tariffs taking effect, which many expect will lead to higher vehicle prices. The White House on Wednesday listed tariff rates for 180 countries that, in most cases, were roughly half of what the Trump administration claims each country has \"charged\" the U.S. It didn't take long for market observers to try and reverse engineer the formula — to confusing results. Many observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries. Such methodology does not necessarily align with the conventional approach to calculate tariffs and would imply the U.S. would have only looked at the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services. The U.S. also appeared to have applied a 10% levy for regions where it is running a trade surplus. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has since laid out its approach, including a formula, on its website that appeared somewhat similar to the online chatter, barring a few differences. Trump quickly declared his \"reciprocal\" tariff rollout a success. \"THE OPERATION IS OVER!\" Trump wrote in an all-caps Truth Social post. \"THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\" The new tariffs have not yet taken effect. Trump's 25% auto tariffs are in effect, but the impacts of the new levies could take years to unfold. The tariffs are on any vehicles imported into the U.S., but even if final assembly takes place domestically, autos are made up of thousands of parts that are sourced from all across the world. That means the industry is watching and waiting to see what happens with potential upcoming tariffs on auto parts. In the near term, auto industry investors should expect continued volatility in automaker and supplier stocks, according to Wall Street analysts.

    "full_content": "Trump's new tariffs elicited threats of retaliation from foreign leaders. U.S. stocks suffered major losses on Thursday at close of the first trading session after President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,679 points, or nearly 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined almost 6%. The S&P 500 tumbled 4.8%, marking its worst trading day since 2020. The selloff hammered shares of some major multinational corporations with supply chains abroad. Nike plummeted 14%, while Apple fell 9%. E-commerce giant Amazon slid nearly 9%. Shares fell for each of the other so-called \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, dropped nearly 9%. Chipmaker Nvidia slid 7%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Trump-advisor Elon Musk, declined 5%. Shares of U.S. retailers that depend largely on imported products also tumbled, with Dollar Tree down 13% and Five Below seeing 27% losses. While Trump said the tariffs would free the U.S. from dependence on foreign goods, fears of a deepened international trade war appeared to influence the stock market reaction. During the event at the White House on Wednesday, Trump unveiled a sweeping set of baseline tariffs on all trading partners and what he described as \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S. \"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" he said. The president announced the measures would include a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all trading partners and, further, more targeted punitive levies on certain countries, including China, the European Union and Taiwan. Trump held up a chart with a list of nations and what the new U.S. tariffs against them will be. At the top was China, which Trump said was set to be hit with a 34% tariff rate as he claimed it charged the United States 67%. The 34% reciprocal rate for China is in addition to a previous 20% tariff Trump slapped on the nation -- bringing the effective tariff rate on one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners to 54% total. While the longstanding effects of Trump's newly minted tariffs stand to be seen, some experts told ABC News ahead of Wednesday that the measures could threaten economic growth and employment since duties slapped on imports risk increasing costs for businesses that rely on raw materials from abroad. \"If both businesses and consumers start to worry and pull back their spending, that is what can tip the U.S. over into a recession,\" Kara Reynolds, an economist at American University, previously told ABC News. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, described the tariffs as \"the fodder for an economic downturn.\" ABC News' Max Zahn contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "full_content": "The chairman of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee said he regrets choosing the F-35 for his country, citing fears that the US may threaten to cease support for the fighter. \"As one of the decision-makers behind Denmark's purchase of F-35s, I regret it,\" Rasmus Jarlov, a member of parliament for the center-right Conservative People's Party, wrote on social media on Wednesday. Jarlov was addressing rumors that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II may have a \"kill-switch\" that allows Washington to remotely disable F-35s purchased by US allies. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the stealth fighter does not have such a feature. But the Danish MP isn't convinced. \"We obviously cannot take your word for it,\" Jarlov wrote in his post. He added that the US could scupper Copenhagen's use of the F-35 just by stopping the supply of spare parts — a similar dilemma that Ukraine faced when Washington temporarily paused military aid. \"I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse,\" wrote Jarlov, who is also his party's spokesperson for his stance on Greenland's affairs. Jarlov further accused the US of wanting \"to strengthen Russia and weaken Europa.\" \"Therefore, buying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible,\" he said. \"I encourage our friends and allies to do the same,\" Jarlov added. Denmark announced in 2016 that it was spending about $3 billion on 27 F-35s to replace its aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. Jarlov was serving as Denmark's defense committee chairman at the time. Copenhagen has received 17 of its orders so far. In a statement to Business Insider, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company \"values our enduring partnership with the Royal Danish Air Force and is committed to strengthening that partnership into the future.\" \"The pressure-tested F-35 program recently surpassed 1 million flight hours across 16 military services flying the aircraft,\" they said. \"We are committed to helping our customers strengthen their airpower and security with the F-35,\" they added. \"As part of our government contracts, we deliver all system infrastructure and data required for all F-35 customers to sustain the aircraft.\" His comments come as President Donald Trump has said that he wants to buy or annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that's rich in minerals and can provide the US with a strategic location near the Arctic. Leaders in both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly resisted Trump's statements, saying their governments had no interest in the territory coming under US administration or rule. \"There is no threat from China against Greenland and China has no presence in Greenland,\" Jarlov wrote on Sunday. \"The only threat against Greenland is the USA.\" Meanwhile, Second Lady Usha Vance, White House national security advisor Mike Waltz, and the Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are expected to visit Greenland on Thursday. Denmark isn't the only country reconsidering its defense reliance on US exports. Leaders in Portugal and Canada have also said they are reviewing their willingness to buy the F-35 amid the geopolitical tensions between the US and its allies. Canada's defense minister, Bill Blair, said his country may be seeking alternatives to the F-35 over concerns of hostility from Washington, which launched steep tariffs against Canadian and Mexican goods earlier this month. Meanwhile, Portugal's outgoing defense minister, Nuno Melo, told local media that his country \"cannot ignore the geopolitical environment in our choices\" on possibly buying the F-35. At least 19 governments, including the UK, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Canada, Australia, and Israel, have agreed to purchase the F-35. The F-35 is one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, and while it has several competitors, its stealth features have been dominant in the market. Other planes considered adjacent or similar in capability are China's Chengdu J-20 and the French Dassault Rafale, which a British think tank said has recently surged in popularity as US ties with its allies fray. South Korea is also developing the KF-21 Boramae, but its stealth systems are expected to be less advanced than the F-35's. The State Department, which oversees foreign sales of US weapons, and Jarlov did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.

    "full_content": "North Korea’s scamming, thieving, and AI-abusing fake IT workers are increasingly targeting European employers. The hermit kingdom (DPRK) runs a corps of operatives who apply for remote tech jobs and, if they get them, funnel their salaries to Kim Jong Un’s coffers. Some also run malware on company computers, steal their employers’ data, then demand ransom payments. Many just do a bad job – sometimes for several employers at a time – so they can be paid multiple salaries. The workers submit impressive CVs and, if they score an interview, try to disguise their accents and appearance. Claiming their webcam is broken, and therefore being unable to appear in interviews, is a favourite tactic. So is using generative AI to create portraits, or even answers in interviews. Sometimes the fake workers slip up after they get a job, by asking that company laptops be sent to an address that doesn’t match the one used in their applications. That can be a sign they’ve recruited a local facilitator who will keep the laptop connected to the grid and the net. The North Koreans then use VPNs to connect to the employer-provided laptops, and make sure they work – or appear to be working – the appropriate local hours. Facilitators also help to shift salaries to Pyongyang. The scam is sophisticated: Even infosec businesses have interviewed and hired North Korean techies. A Tuesday post penned by Jamie Collier, lead adviser at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, reports “an increase of active operations in Europe” by such workers. “DPRK IT workers' activity across multiple countries now establishes them as a global threat,” the post states. “While the United States remains a key target, over the past months, DPRK IT workers have encountered challenges in seeking and maintaining employment in the country. This is likely due to increased awareness of the threat through public reporting, United States Department of Justice indictments, and right-to-work verification challenges,” the post states. “These factors have instigated a global expansion of IT worker operations, with a notable focus on Europe,” Collier added. Google, and un-named partners, have spotted North Korean IT workers “seeking employment in Germany and Portugal\" and also found \"login credentials for user accounts of European job websites and human capital management platforms.” Investigators also found “fabricated personas, including resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and residences in Slovakia, as well as instructions for navigating European job sites.” “One document provided specific guidance on seeking employment in Serbia, including the use of a Serbian time zone during communications. Info on how to acquire false passports was also found. presumably so the fake techies can provide credentials that allow them to establish a right to work or open bank accounts. The North Korean operatives sought work on platforms including Upwork, Telegram, and Freelancer. Some sought payment in cryptocurrency, or through services like TransferWise and Payoneer. Google also thinks its found evidence of sophisticated facilitators in the UK. “One incident involved a DPRK IT worker using facilitators located in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Notably, a corporate laptop, ostensibly intended for use in New York, was found to be operational in London, indicating a complex logistical chain,” Collier wrote. The Googler thinks the fake workers are now targeting companies that operate a Bring Your Own Device (BOYD) policy, because if they can use their own hardware it’s unlikely corporate management tools can touch it. BYOD also means employers don’t need to send workers a laptop, so there’s no postal address that investigators can use to start probing a worker if things go pear-shaped. Google thinks investigations will be needed, because it’s also seen North Korean fakers increasingly targeting larger employers and more often attempting extortion. “In these incidents, recently fired IT workers threatened to release their former employers’ sensitive data or to provide it to a competitor. This data included proprietary data and source code for internal projects,” Collier wrote, before suggesting the increase in extortion attempts may be linked to increased US action against fake workers that make them desperate to maintain their ill-gotten revenues. Avoiding this scam isn’t easy, because the perps are sophisticated, but the FBI has issued guidance about how to spot fake North Korean techies. Telltale signs include evading in-person meetings, changing preferred payment methods on freelance work platforms, and online profiles that don’t include an image. ® Send us news",

    "full_content": "A Houston janitor was sentenced to six years in prison for urinating in women's water bottles, resulting in one of them contracting herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), police said. Lucio Diaz, 53, pleaded guilty on March 18 to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon stemming from multiple incidents that occurred on Sept. 26, 2022, at a medical building, Harris County court records say. According to a complaint filed in October 2022, multiple women accused Diaz of using his bodily fluids as a deadly weapon when he urinated in their water bottles. A $1 million lawsuit was filed by Houston-based law firm Abraham Watkins on behalf of 13 women in 2023 against Diaz, his employers and his supervisors, KPRC and ABC13 reported. USA TODAY contacted Abraham Watkins, who said they are working on providing a statement. The initial woman who reported Diaz's behavior said everything began on Aug. 30, 2022, when she noticed the water coming from the medical building's employee water dispenser had a \"funny taste and smell to it,\" according to the complaint. The woman would immediately dump the water out and throw her bottle away, the court document said. She then began bringing her own 16-ounce bottle to work, which she would often leave on her desk for the next day due to her not being able to drink it all, the complaint reads. According to the complaint, the woman then told police that after a few days went by, she noticed her personal water bottle randomly \"smelled nasty,\" but she could not figure out why. This prompted her to trash her water bottle, and to go buy another one, the document states. It was not until Sept. 22, 2022, that she realized urine was in her water bottle after a colleague brought it to her attention, the complaint says. Once a urinalysis test determined the water in the woman's bottle tested positive for urine, another woman in the same building said the same thing happened to her, according to the court document. To catch whoever was urinating in women's bottles, the initial woman set up a hidden camera under her computer and left her water bottle capped before heading home on Sept. 26, the complaint reads. Shortly after the woman left, the camera caught Diaz opening her water bottle, unzipping his pants and putting his penis inside the bottle before closing and placing it back on her desk, the court filing says. The woman reported the incident to Houston police on Sept. 27 and gave the officers two different water bottles as evidence, one containing urine and the other one that Diaz put his penis inside, the complaint reads. When police officers confronted Diaz, he admitted to sticking his penis inside the woman's water bottle on two separate occasions, according to the court document. When officers asked Diaz why he urinated in the bottles, the janitor said he did it because he knew the woman would drink it the next day, the complaint says. On Oct. 10, 2022, a separate woman who was victimized by Diaz told police that she tested positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 and chlamydia after drinking from her urine-contaminated water bottle, according to the court document.",

    "full_content": "The Chinese military said Tuesday it had launched joint exercises involving its army, navy, air force and rocket force around Taiwan as a “stern warning,” days after US defense chief Pete Hegseth vowed to counter “China’s aggression” on his first visit to Asia.\n     \n            China’s armed forces will “close in” on the self-governing island from “multiple directions” in the drills and practice maneuvers including “assault on maritime and ground targets” and “blockade on key areas and sea lanes” to test joint operations capabilities of the troops, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)’s Eastern Theater Command said in a statement on social media.\n     \n            “It is a stern warning and forceful deterrence against ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” the statement added.\n     \n            China’s latest military exercises come as Taiwan is looking on nervously as US President Donald Trump transforms Washington’s global relationships with his mercantilist “America First” foreign policy, discarding decades-old guarantees towards Europe and pushing long-standing Asian allies and partners to pay more for US protection.\n     \n            Meanwhile, officials close to Trump have repeatedly emphasized the need for the US to focus its attention and resources on countering China’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.\n     \n            For Taiwan, a democracy of some 23 million people that sits just 80 miles from China at its nearest point, the drills are the latest reminder of the threat that comes from its giant Communist Party-run neighbor, which claims the island as its own and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary.\n     \n            Taiwan officials have condemned the drills as “reckless” and “irresponsible.”\n     \n            “It came without justification, violates international laws and is totally unacceptable. Democracies need to condemn China for being a troublemaker,” Joseph Wu, secretary-general of Taiwan’s National Security Council, said in a post on social platform X.\n     \n            The Taiwanese Defense Ministry said it detected 71 Chinese military aircraft and 13 PLA navy vessels near Taiwan, as well as a group of warships led by China’s first domestically built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, in the West Pacific.\n     \n            The ministry added that its troops are on “high vigilance” to respond to the situation.\n     \n            Taiwan’s military dispatched its own aircraft and ships, and deployed land-based missile systems to closely monitor the situation and respond appropriately, the island’s Defense Ministry said in a statement about the Shandong aircraft carrier group.\n     \n            The Eastern Theater Command released a video of the PLA taking part in the drills on Tuesday, showing Chinese frigates sailing, military aircraft taking off and missiles being erected into launch position.\n     \n            Later in the day, it said it organized naval and air force formations to conduct exercises in the northern, southern and eastern waters surrounding Taiwan, in coordination with conventional missiles and long-range rocket artillery. It did not say how long the exercises would last.\n     \n            In Taiwan, government officials and experts view the Chinese drills as a signal to the Trump administration, where several key cabinet officials are hawkish on China, in particular Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n     \n            During his first trip to Asia as US defense secretary last week, Hegseth vowed to enhance America’s military alliance with the Philippines to “reestablish deterrence” to counter “China’s aggression” in the Indo-Pacific region, and called Japan an “indispensable partner in deterring communist Chinese military aggression,” including across the Taiwan Strait.\n     \n            An internal analysis by the Taiwan government cited Hegseth’s visit as among the “external reasons” for China’s latest drills.\n     \n            “They have reaffirmed the importance of security and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and confirmed that the US is shifting its security focus to the Indo-Pacific region. This has put great pressure on Beijing’s intentions,” according to the analysis, shared with CNN by a senior Taiwanese national security official.\n     \n            “Faced with upcoming US-China trade talks and the expected measures against China, Beijing has opted for restraint to avoid actions that could be seen as directly confronting the US. Taiwan serves as the perfect pretext, prompting Beijing to launch these military drills immediately after the US Secretary of Defense left Asia,” the analysis added.\n     \n            Su Tzu-yun, a director at the Institute for National Defense Security Research in Taiwan, said unlike the two “Joint Sword-2024” military drills China conducted last year, the latest exercises came as a “surprise” on Tuesday morning.\n     \n            “I think Beijing is trying to show its signal to Washington,” Su said.\n     \n            On Tuesday, China’s coast guard said it also launched “law-enforcement patrols” in waters surrounding Taiwan, carrying out drills including interception and detention of “unwarranted vessels.”\n     \n            The Chinese military has ramped up regular patrols as well as military exercises in the air and waters around Taiwan, part of a broader assertiveness of China’s territorial claims under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n     \n            Major exercises often serve as means for Beijing to express displeasure with the island – as well as to better understand how Taiwan monitors and responds to military pressure from China.\n     \n            China’s military has in recent years launched drills encircling Taiwan and simulating a blockade of the island – one of the strategies that experts say could be used if Beijing ultimately decides to move to take control using military might.\n     \n            Zhang Chi, a professor at the PLA’s National Defense University in Beijing, said Tuesday’s drills don’t have a specific codename because such military exercises have increasingly become routine.\n     \n            “This largely indicates that the exercises we see today have become a new normal for the PLA and the Eastern Theater Command – it’s routine for them,” he told China’s state broadcaster CCTV.\n \n            Beijing has repeatedly accused Taiwan’s leaders of seeking “independence,” and views Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te as a “separatist,” launching large-scale drills days after Lai’s inauguration last year.\n     \n            On Tuesday, the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command released a series of propaganda videos after announcing the latest drills, including one that depicts Lai as a green cartoon bug and calls him a “parasite” hollowing out the island.\n     \n            Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, called the military exercises “a resolute warning to the Lai Ching-te administration’s rampant provocations for ‘independence.’”\n     \n            Lai, who has long been a champion of Taiwan’s sovereignty, has called on China to cease its intimidation, but he has also spoken frequently of the importance of maintaining “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”\n     \n            Polls consistently show people in Taiwan, a thriving and outspoken democracy, have no desire to be ruled by China, an authoritarian one-party state.\n     \n            The latest drills follow a series of incidents that have ratcheted up tensions across the Taiwan Strait, including Taipei’s detention in late February of a cargo ship crewed by Chinese nationals it was investigating for allegedly cutting an undersea internet cable in the second such incident in a period of months.\n     \n            Last month, Lai called China a “foreign hostile force” and ramped up national security measures to combat Chinese espionage and infiltration. Days later, Taiwan deported a Chinese influencer for backing a military takeover of the island democracy by Beijing.\n     \n            Taiwan has long been seen as a potential flashpoint that could spark hot conflict between China and the United States.\n     \n            The US maintains unofficial relations with Taipei and is bound by law to provide Taiwan with weapons for its defense. Washington has long maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would come to Taiwan’s defense in the event of an incursion from China.\n     \nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

    "full_content": "Apple on Monday released visionOS 2.4, and it’s the first update to enable Apple Intelligence features in Apple Vision Pro. However, even though the update was released on the same day as iOS 18.4 – which expands AI capabilities to more languages – Apple Intelligence for Vision Pro is only available in English. In a note on Apple’s website, the company notes that the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro is only available in US English. This means that Vision Pro users must set both the system language and Siri to US English before enabling AI features. When Apple Intelligence arrived on iOS, it was also limited to US English. With iOS 18.2, Apple has expanded its AI tools to more variations of English. Now with iOS 18.4, Apple Intelligence is also available in French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese, and Spanish. The Apple Intelligence features in Vision Pro are pretty much the same as those already available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and text summarization. Apple hasn’t made any specific AI features for Vision Pro, and it doesn’t have Visual Intelligence like the iPhone. Since Vision Pro is only available in a few countries around the world, it’s understandable that Apple hasn’t rushed to add support for more languages just yet. In addition to Apple Intelligence, visionOS 2.4 adds a new Spatial Gallery app with photos, videos and spatial panoramas curated by Apple. The update also makes it easier to share a Vision Pro with a guest. You can install visionOS 2.4 by going to Settings > General > Software Update. It’s worth noting that Apple Vision Pro is currently available in Australia, Canada, China mainland, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, the UAE, the UK, and the US.

    "full_content": "Donald Trump has called tariffs the “most beautiful word” in the dictionary. He’s said they will make Americans “rich” and restructure the economy for the better. Standing in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, with political and business leaders around the world watching closely, Trump bet his faith in tariffs against the hard reality of economics as he launched what is expected to be one of the single largest increases in U.S. trade barriers in a century. Advertisement Advertisement Trump announced he was signing an executive order “instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal—that means they do it to us and we do it to them.” In practice, the White House said that will translate into a new 10 percent tariff on all imported goods, and additional import taxes on 60 other countries. Those additional tariffs vary and were determined by looking at the rules in those countries around U.S. exports, according to the White House. Trump’s new tariff regime will be on top of various tariffs the U.S. already has in place, and ones Trump had already set in motion targeting imports of cars, steel and aluminum. The reciprocal tariffs would go into effect Thursday, he said. Speaking to staff, cabinet secretaries and reporters gathered outside the West Wing, Trump gave a rambling and sometimes contradictory explanation of his tariff plan. He said that his administration would calculate what a country charges the U.S. imports through tariffs, “non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating” and would charge the country half of that in a flat rate. The new tariffs were not a “full reciprocal,” he said. “I would like to have done that.” Reading from a large chart, he said goods coming from China, for example, would be charged a duty of 34%, goods from the European Union would carry a 20% tariff, Vietnam would have 35% and Taiwan 32%. An eight-page chart handed out to reporters in the Rose Garden listed 60 countries as being charged rates above the baseline of 10%. Trump had previously announced a separate 25% tariff on all auto imports that is slated to kick in on April 3. He’s imposed 20% tariffs on all imports coming from China and put in place 25% duties on steel and aluminum. He had previously delayed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada over his accusation that those countries weren’t doing enough to stop fentanyl from coming to the U.S. That delayed tariff kicks in Wednesday and will be stacked on top of the new sweeping tariffs Trump announced. Trump has called the day of his announcement “Liberation Day” and billed it as a moment he is remaking the American economy.  He promised that income from the new tariffs would reduce taxes and pay down U.S. debt. American businesses have struggled in recent weeks to plan ahead as Trump’s tariff threats have injected so much uncertainty into their supply chains. Stock indices have dipped. Expectations of inflation have soared. Investors are rattled. Last month, JPMorgan Chase lowered its prediction for GDP growth by 0.3% because of the uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy. Leading economists say the costs of tariffs are mostly passed on to consumers. On the campaign trail last year, Trump often disputed that. More recently, he has said Americans will have to brace for some temporary economic pain in order to strengthen the U.S. economy over the longer term. But he didn’t mention that on Wednesday. Trump's announcement will test his support among Republicans in Congress—all of whom will be hearing about the fallout from their constituents. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley expressed concerns about how the new tariffs will impact farmers in his state. As an example of the ripple effect, he pointed to potash, a fertilizer from Canada that is essential for soybean production. “If that goes up by 25% that's going to hurt the family farm already not making money,” he tells TIME. —WITH REPORTING BY NIK POPLI",

    "full_content": "The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models. That's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia. Huang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it. Here's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background. Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington. His uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. Huang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland. Before founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985. At a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation. In 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU. Today, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models. Interest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights. In one notable milestone, Nvidia's market cap passed $3 trillion in 2024 to briefly overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company. Huang's net worth is $105.4 billion, according to Forbes. Huang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day. Current and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes. Huang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays. He has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share. Huang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product. Nvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang. Priem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia. After Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023. Huang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company. Huang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins. He has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Huang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award. In past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people. As of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.",

    "full_content": "The Marine Corps is known for its famous shooting and drill teams. Now, the service is adding a new competitive, precision weapons team to its ranks — a drone team. \"Today's battlefield is changing rapidly, and we must adapt just as quickly,\" said Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion. Tavizon will oversee the newly created Marine Corps Attack Drone Team, a leading part of the service's efforts to catch up with advancements in drone warfare overseas, a Marine Corps statement said. \"The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team will ensure that our warfighters remain at the forefront of precision drone employment, providing a critical advantage in future conflicts,\" he said. \"By leveraging emerging technologies and refining drone employment tactics, we are ensuring that Marines remain agile, adaptive, and lethal in the modern battlespace,\" Tavizon added. This effort isn't coming out of the blue, and arrives as modern combat is increasingly defined by unmanned weapon systems. The Marine Corps said that \"the creation of MCADT comes in response to the rapid proliferation of armed first-person view drone technology and tactics observed in modern conflicts, particularly in Eastern Europe,\" a clear reference to the Ukraine war where uncrewed combat is prolific. The new drone team will be based with the service's Warfighting Laboratory and Weapons Training Battalion, with design based rooted in the Corps' competitive shooting team, a group that has long guided training development for the rest of the force. That the service has chosen to house its couple warfare efforts with its prestigious shooting team may highlight just how seriously it's taking drone warfare. The Corps considers the rifle to be the bedrock weapon for all Marines regardless of their job, part of the service's \"every Marine a rifleman\" mentality. Housing the drone team with the Weapons Training Battalion, the Corps' ultimate repository of small arms knowledge, could signal how drastically the service is trying to shift to the future. \"Right now, our focus is on rapidly building proficiency by sending Marines to a variety of training courses and increasing hands-on familiarization,\" Tavizon said. \"Our goal is to ensure they can not only operate these systems effectively but also integrate them seamlessly into a team.\" The Corps explained that it's using different small drone systems to facilitate \"precision strikes up to 20 kilometers for under $5,000 —offering a more cost-effective and capable alternative to traditional weapons systems.\" The team is set to represent the Corps in drone competitions around the world, with its first competition slated for this summer at the National Drone Association's Military Drone Crucible Championship, a competition meant to simulate drone usage in modern combat. \"MCADT will execute tactical missions using FPVs and small UAS in realistic scenarios designed to simulate modern combat,\" the Corps said, referring to the kind of first-person-view drones and uncrewed aerial systems that have been used extensively in Ukraine. The new attack team will also be responsible for integrating key lessons learned from drone warfare overseas. The drone team's establishment comes as the US military continues to tackle important problems.  First, the Pentagon is figuring out how to quickly procure rapidly changing technology, like drones, which is a significant change from the notoriously cumbersome military-industrial complex that ballooned throughout the Global War on Terror.  Second, the services are trying to apply lessons learned from relevant conflicts overseas, such as the war in Ukraine, to help shape plans for future warfare. Ukraine continues to serve as a sort of test bed for drone experimentation that militaries across the globe are watching closely. Ukrainian and Russian forces are grappling with terrifying advancements, including drones with mounted shotguns, others that release molten thermite to pour over enemy positions, and drones piloted with AI assistance to boost strike accuracy. Pacific nations are also taking note of Ukrainian developments— a Taiwan company recently announced the creation of a new \"sea drone\" designed to fire small torpedoes or ram into targets inspired by Ukrainian attacks on Russia's Black Sea Fleet.",

    "full_content": "China continues a second day of war games and military drills around Taiwan, including simulated attacks on key targets. Chinese military drills around Taiwan continue for the second day China’s military said it has simulated attacks on high-value targets in Taiwan, including ports and energy facilities, as it carried out “live-fire” military drills around the self-ruled island on the second day of war-game exercises. The drills on Wednesday, part of an operation titled “Strait Thunder-2025A”, were conducted in the middle and southern parts of the Taiwan Strait as well as the East China Sea, the military said. “Long-range live-fire drills” were carried out in order to practise hitting “simulated targets of key ports and energy facilities” during the exercises, the military said. The aim was to “test the troops’ capabilities” in areas such as “blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets”, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman of the Chinese military’s Eastern Theatre Command. China’s Shandong aircraft carrier was also deployed in the drills, testing the ability to “blockade” Taiwan by integrating naval and air power, the Eastern Theatre Command said. China’s military published a video of what it said were the live-fire drills that showed rockets, rather than ballistic missiles, being launched and hitting targets on land, and an animation of explosions over Taiwanese cities including Tainan, Hualien and Taichung, all home to military bases and ports. Taiwan’s President William Lai Ching-te condemned the drills while the island’s defence ministry said China had deployed 21 warships around the island, including the Shandong carrier group, and 71 aircraft and four coastguard vessels on Tuesday. “China’s blatant military provocations not only threaten peace in the #Taiwan Strait but also undermine security in the entire region, as evidenced by drills near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines & the SCS [South China Sea]. We strongly condemn China’s escalatory behaviour,” Taiwan’s Presidential Office said in a post on X. On Wednesday, Taiwan said that 76 Chinese military aircraft and 19 naval or government ships had entered waters and airspace near the island over the previous 24 hours, with 37 of the planes crossing the centre line in the 160-kilometre (110-mile) wide Taiwan Strait that forms an unofficial border with mainland China, but which Beijing refuses to acknowledge. The Shandong aircraft carrier group had also entered Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, a self-defined security area tracked by the Taiwanese military.      Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said the exercises were not the first conducted by China around Taiwan but these latest drills “show how serious Beijing is about honing their capability to blockade the island of Taiwan should they deem necessary”. “Beijing sees Taiwan, the democratic ruled island, as a breakaway Chinese province, and President Xi Jinping has said time and time again, that whether by peaceful means or by force, it will be unified again with mainland China,” Yu said. “Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te has condemned the drills. He says, this is only demonstrating that China is a troublemaker in this region,” Yu added. The drills are expected to continue until Thursday night and China’s Maritime Safety Administration has announced that an area off the northern part of the eastern province of Zhejiang, more than 500km (310 miles) from Taiwan, will be closed for shipping due to military operations.",

    "full_content": "A North Dakota jury on Wednesday found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The jury found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims and awarded Dallas-based Energy Transfer and subsidiary Dakota Access more than $650 million in damages. The lawsuit accused Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. of defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts. Advertisement Advertisement Greenpeace said earlier that a large award to the pipeline company would threaten to bankrupt the environmental group. Following the nine-person jury’s verdict, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser said the organization’s work “is never going to stop.” The independent global campaigning network has been fighting for a wide array of environmental issues for more than half a century and has a long history of contentious legal battles. Here are some things to know: Environmental activists founded the group in Vancouver, Canada, in 1971. The network’s first action was to work to stop more nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian island chain in southwest Alaska. They took a ship toward the island to “bear witness,\" which is a Quaker protest tradition, but were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, according to the Greenpeace website. The U.S. later opted to abandon their nuclear testing grounds on the island, marking Greenpeace's first major victory. During initial work to stop the nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka, Canadian ecologist Bill Darnell was leaving one of the group’s meetings when someone held up two fingers and said “peace!” according to Greenpeace’s website. Darnell, who is considered a founding member of Greenpeace, replied: “Let’s make it a Green Peace.” The name was condensed into one word so it could fit on buttons for the group’s first fundraiser. Greenpeace describes itself as the largest environmental campaigning organization in the world. It is made up of dozens of independent national or regional organizations in more than 55 countries, according to its website. Its work to preserve and restore valuable ecosystems and push back on fossil fuel corporations is centered on nonviolent action. Its protests have ranged from efforts to stop Shell from drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic to demonstrations to put an end to France’s atmospheric tests in the South Pacific to campaigns to conserve Canada’s coastal rainforest. Greenpeace and its activists have also been the target of charges and lawsuits, including in 2023 when four activists were arrested for scaling the country estate of former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and draping it in black fabric to protest his plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. They were later cleared of criminal charges. It was also one of the environmental groups that filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Willow oil project in Alaska in recent years.

    "full_content": "For months in early 2024, conservatives like myself tried to sound the alarm on President Joe Biden's declining physical and mental health. It was obvious that he was unwell. Yet, Democrats and much of the legacy news media ignored that reality and even attacked those of us who were willing to speak the truth. They claimed we were fabricating tales and spreading baseless conspiracy theories. Now, the narrative has changed dramatically. Journalists are publishing books and news articles detailing not only Biden's poor health but also an orchestrated cover-up inside the White House. According to one of the books, even one of Biden's closest former aides now admits that the commander in chief was \"out of it\" last year as he attempted to run for reelection. This is one of the biggest scandals of my adult life. Now we know that Biden's inner circle deliberately misled the American people in an election year about the incumbent president's ability to serve a second term. We also know that journalists were far too passive, at best, in reporting revelations that Americans needed to know before the election. Opinion: Republicans don't need Trump to run again. Vance is ready to take the lead. Politico reported last week that at least four books will be published in the next few weeks that provide new details about Biden's failing health and the conspiracy to cover it up. One of those books, \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” by NBC News' Jonathan Allen and The Hill's Amie Parnes, includes incredible details about Biden's poor health while he was still in office. The authors report that Democratic leaders were worried that Biden could not win another election and had “hush-hush talks” discussing his potential withdrawal from the race as early as 2023. Biden did withdraw, but not until July 2024, after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump. The most damning part of \"Fight\" is the revelation that Vice President Kamala Harris' aides were so concerned about the president's health that they \"strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office.\" The authors report that Jamal Simmons, the vice president's communications director, drew up a “death-pool roster” of federal judges who could swear in Harris as president if Biden died. In “Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History,\" author Chris Whipple details Biden's serious mental and physical decline. “I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden’s final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story,\" Whipple told Politico. After extensive reporting, Whipple, a former \"60 Minutes\" producer, came to the conclusion that Democrats were in deep denial about Biden's condition: “I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.” Ron Klain, a longtime aide to Biden and his former White House chief of staff, helped the president prepare for his fateful debate with Trump last year. Klain told Whipple that Biden “didn’t know what Trump had been saying and couldn’t grasp what the back and forth was.” Klain also described how Biden “didn’t really understand what his argument was on inflation” and “had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job.” Opinion: I'm tired of being mocked and hated because I'm a conservative woman Biden didn't just run for reelection, quit and pass the torch to Harris. He was the sitting president, who was in serious decline and was surrounded by people who knew it but stayed silent. A Washington Post review of \"Fight\" notes, \"So much fresh material, so many bruised egos, so many scores to settle. ... Every one of them saw the wreck coming, of course, in the instant the train lurched out of the station, but no one would listen.

But Americans deserved to be told the truth at least a year ago, not months after the 2024 election. The fact that they weren't is a scandal not only for Democrats but much of the legacy media as well. Democratic insiders knew that concerns about the president's ability to continue serving were serious. Journalists who covered the president had ample evidence to suggest those concerns were valid. Only now, a year too late, are they finally telling us the truth. Nicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

    "full_content": "The president also announced a China tariffs increase to 125%. United States stocks closed with major gains on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs, marking a reversal from days earlier when Trump said the policy would \"never change.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2,962 points, or 7.8%, marking the index's best day since 2020. The S&P 500 jumped 9.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.1%. The spike in the three major stock indexes erased much of the losses suffered in the aftermath of sweeping new tariffs issued by Trump a week ago. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the higher tariffs for most countries that he announced last week, while maintaining a 10% baseline tariff across the board. Speaking later in the day, Trump said he enacted the policy reversal because people were \"getting yippy\" amid the tariff fallout. \"I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy. You know, we're getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,\" he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. Even after the rally, markets remained lower than where they stood before Trump rolled out his \"reciprocal\" tariff plan at a Rose Garden event on April 2. Trump on Wednesday also announced additional tariffs on China, increasing the cumulative tariffs on Chinese goods from 104% to 125%. The escalation came in response to a fresh round of tariffs from China that raised levies on U.S. goods to 84%. European Union countries also backed the European Commission's proposal to push back on Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum with a set of countermeasures on Wednesday. In Europe, key indices dropped on opening Wednesday. The British FTSE 100 dropped by 2.2%, Germany's Dax index dropped 2.3%, France's CAC 40 fell by 2.4% and Spain's Ibex index was down 2%. The pan-European STOXX index was down 2.6%. The market rally followed tumult on Tuesday, when U.S. stocks closed lower, marking a major reversal from a rally that sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq up more than 4% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 320 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.1%. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, putting the index on the brink of a bear market, a term that indicates a 20% drop from a previous peak. The move lower on Tuesday resumed a selloff that stretched back to Trump's tariff announcement April 2. Since then, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have each fallen more than 12%. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
