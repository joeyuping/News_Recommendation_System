    "full_content": "The UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) is launching an appeal to help the thousands of people injured and displaced as a result of last week's powerful earthquake which struck Myanmar and the wider region. Made up of 15 UK aid agencies, including the British Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the Children, the DEC is asking the British public for donations before the monsoon season arrives in two months. More than 2,800 people have died and more than 4,500 have been injured, according to the leaders of Myanmar's military government, with figures expected to rise. The charities say shelter, medicine, food, water and cash support is \"urgently needed\". Baroness Chapman, minister for development, said public donations to the DEC appeal would be matched pound-for-pound by the government, up to the value of £5m. DEC's chief executive Saleh Saeed said the situation was \"ever more critical.\" \"Funds are urgently needed to help families access life-saving humanitarian aid following this catastrophe,\" he said. Multiple international aid agencies and foreign governments have dispatched personnel and supplies to quake-hit regions. Myanmar was already facing a severe humanitarian crisis before the 7.7 magnitude earthquake due to the ongoing civil war there, with the DEC estimating a third of the population is in need of aid. The country has been gripped by violence amid the conflict between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. On Wednesday, Myanmar's military government announced a temporary ceasefire lasting until 22 April, saying it was aimed at expediting relief and reconstruction efforts.  Rebel groups had already unilaterally declared a ceasefire to support relief efforts earlier this week, but the military had refused to do the same until Wednesday's announcement. Aid workers have come under attack in Myanmar. On Tuesday night, the army opened fire at a Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies.  Nine of the charity's vehicles came under attack. The UN and some charities have accused the military junta of blocking access. The US Geological Survey's modelling estimates Myanmar's death toll could exceed 10,000, while the cost in damages to infrastructure could surpass the country's annual economic output. Roads, water services and buildings including hospitals have been destroyed, especially in Mandalay, the hard-hit city near the epicentre. In Thailand, at least 21 people have died.  The Red Cross has also issued an urgent appeal for $100m (£77m), while the UN is seeking $8m in donations for its response. \"People urgently require medical care, clean drinking water, tents, food, and other basic necessities,\" the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said on Monday. The DEC brings together 15 leading UK aid charities to provide and deliver aid to ensure successful appeals. The appeal will be broadcast on the BBC and other media outlets throughout Thursday.",

    "full_content": "A report published this week by the National Hurricane Center revealed the brutal impact of Hurricane Helene, which hit the American Southeast in late September 2024. The center reports that Hurricane Helene was the deadliest storm since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The report found that Helene “is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States (including at least 175 direct deaths),” making it the deadliest storm in 20 years. You can read the NHC’s comprehensive report here. Hurricane preparedness is critical in minimizing loss of property and life. Whether it’s boarding up windows, sandbagging homes, or simply up and leaving, getting early warnings of extreme weather is critical to mitigating damage from those storms. In Helene’s case, flash flooding (as the name suggests) happened quite suddenly, and far inland, catching many by surprise. Direct fatalities occur due to a storm’s immediate impactsâwhether it be flooding, rip currents, landslides, or falling trees. Ninety-four people died from Helene’s flooding and the resulting landslides, according to the report, with the second deadliest culprit being wind, which caused 65 direct deaths. Currently, about 10% of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration staff are either laid off or not allowed to work due to Trump administration-driven cuts whose legality is now being determined by the courts; last week, Gizmodo spoke with a meteorologist and hurricane hunter who flew through several storms, including Helene, about the situation. ‘We Just Want to Get Back to Work’: NOAA Hurricane Hunter Speaks Out After Trump’s Layoffs When Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm, it knocked out power for millions of people across the American southeast and caused flooding as far inland as Tennessee and western North Carolina. The storm plunged swathes of Georgia and the Carolinas into darkness, captured in eerie satellite images. Helene’s impacts weren’t just felt on the ground. The International Space Station’s Atmospheric Waves Experiment (AWE) captured images of gravity waves in Earth’s atmosphere, churned up by the intense storm. 2024’s hurricanes were strong and unpredictable across the board; consider Hurricane Milton, which swelled from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 event in just seven hours. The Atlantic hurricanes last season took advantage of especially moist conditionsâbreeding ground for intense storms. Helene’s death toll is dwarfed by that of Hurricane Katrina, which reportedly caused nearly 1,400 deaths, including 520 direct deaths. Many of the 565 indirect fatalities (318) were cardiovascular in nature, and 307 additional fatalities could not be definitively labeled as either directly or indirectly caused by Katrina. Hurricane season doesn’t start back up until June 30, and will run through November 30. Here’s hoping that NOAA can sort out its staffing issues before the worst comes to pass. \nDeathsHurricanehurricane heleneKatrinaStorm  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          After mass layoffs at NOAA, meteorologist Andrew Hazelton finds himself in a bureaucratic no manâs landâfired, then reinstated, but still unable to work.\n         \n          The hurricane jumped three Safford-Simpson hurricane categories in less than a day, and scientists now propose a new factor that contributed to the storm's evolution.\n         \n          NASA satellites spotted five tropical cyclones churning in the Indian and Pacific Oceans late this month, revealing different points in the storms' developments.\n         \n          Heavy hitters like Helene and Milton characterized an Atlantic storm season that was especially moist, breeding tornadoes on the coast and flood far inland.\n         \n          The Category 4 storm kicked up atmospheric swells many miles above Earth's surface.\n         \n          ...but that's not all!",

    "full_content": "After senior Trump administration members mistakenly included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a secret group chat about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen, encrypted messaging app Signal found itself at the center of a storm this week. Some commentators criticized the app, going as far to blame it for the scandal. But the whole affair that’s dubiously been dubbed “SignalGate” isn’t about Signal at all: Experts say officials shouldn’t invite untrusted contacts into sensitive chats and should only use authorized devices, platforms, and procedures when discussing top-secret military operations. In other words, the people who set up the chat made numerous mistakes, and they had nothing to do with how secure Signal is. In fact, Signal has seen its biggest-ever spike in US downloads as a result of the news. In other news linked to that Houthi group chat, national security adviser Mike Waltz—an account with the name “Michael Waltz” originally invited Goldberg to the group—left his Venmo account open to public view. As WIRED reported, a “Michael Waltz” Venmo account displayed the names of the adviser’s colleagues and friends, revealing people in Waltz’s wider social network. After WIRED reached out to the White House, the Waltz account hid its friends list. There’s more though: WIRED also discovered other Venmo accounts linked to officials in the Signal chat. Information about who officials associate with could be highly lucrative for foreign spies and hackers. Elsewhere, we reported on all the ways the White House adopting Elon Musk’s Starlink as an alternative Wi-Fi network could be bad news for network security. There are also early signs in Europe that some companies are going cold on cloud services from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as they reassess the risks of dealing with the volatile second Trump administration. And, as crossing the United States border becomes more perilous—for both citizens and visa holders—we updated our guide to keeping your digital privacy intact when you are entering the US. That’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Top US Security Officials’ Passwords and Personal Phone Numbers Discovered Online On top of SignalGate and Venmo accounts being left exposed, German news outlet Der Spiegel reported that sensitive personal information linked to several senior Trump administration security officials is easily discoverable online. Reporters from the publication found that mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and “some” passwords for top officials could be found on the internet. Using people-search engines and information contained in public data breaches, Der Spiegel discovered personal information belonging to Waltz, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense. “Most of these numbers and email addresses are apparently still in use, with some of them linked to profiles on social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn,” the news organization reported. The details were also linked to Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Signal, and WhatsApp accounts used by the officials. While millions of people have been caught up in online data breaches and use inadequate privacy settings on their online accounts, high-level government security officials are exposed to a broader and more severe range of online threats, particularly from nation-state hackers, than most people. Officials told the news organization that many of the accounts and personal details were no longer used or had been updated. However, messages Der Spiegel sent to WhatsApp and Signal accounts belonging to Waltz and Gabbard were delivered, the publication reported. Only after they approached the government for comment were some of the accounts restricted. Internet Restrictions May Hide Initial Toll of Myanmar Earthquake Damage On Friday, a huge 7.7-magnitude earthquake and aftershock hit Myanmar, with widespread damage being reported hundreds of miles away in Thailand. At the time of writing, at least 144 people have been confirmed dead with hundreds of others injured in Myanmar. As the first impacts of the devastating quake started to emerge, The New York Times reported that long-standing and widespread internet restrictions in worn-torn Myanmar were likely making it harder for news of the damage to be understood. Since the country’s military junta took power in 2021, connectivity within Myanmar has been widely disrupted or blocked. For instance in 2023, 13 out of Myanmar’s 14 states faced internet disruptions. In the wake of the earthquake, more video footage and news could be seen immediately emerging from neighbouring Thailand, experts told the Times. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Joe Freeman from Amnesty International said. The lack of connectivity may also make the recovery and humanitarian efforts harder to coordinate, once again highlighting the vital need for people to have reliable and open access to the internet. Alleged Snowflake Hacker Connor Moucka Agrees to US Extradition Last summer’s Snowflake hacking spree, where customers of the cloud storage company had their accounts targeted, was likely one of the largest mass data exfiltrations that’s publicly known. Toward the end of 2024, Canadian authorities arrested Alexander “Connor” Moucka, 26, who allegedly used online handles such as “Waifu” and “Judische,” in connection to the hacking activity. This week, Moucka consented to be extradited to the United States to face the alleged charges. According to Cyberscoop, Moucka faces 20 federal charges, including those linked to computer fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Moucka is not the only person allegedly behind the Snowflake hacking, with John Binns and Cameron Wagenius being named in indictments. It is unclear when Moucka’s extradition will take place. London Is Getting Its First Permanent Face Recognition Cameras Police forces across the UK have massively increased their use of live face recognition cameras in recent years. Use of the controversial technology has historically been temporary: mounting cameras on top of police vehicles and deploying them for specific events and set periods of time. That’s now set to change with the first permanent face recognition cameras being rolled out in London. The city’s Metropolitan Police are in the process of installing fixed cameras in Croydon, in the south of the city. “This will mean our use of LFR technology will be far more embedded as a ‘business as usual’ approach rather than relying on the availability of the LFR vans that are in high demand across London,” a police official wrote in a letter seen by The Times of London. Reportedly, the cameras will not be used continuously, only when officers are nearby to monitor potential alerts. However, privacy campaigners fear the move could be further rolled out across the city, leading to a network of permanent face recognition cameras unlike those seen in any other democratic countries.",

    "full_content": "Residential damage in Augusta caused by Hurricane Helene has reached $282m (Â£220m) The manicured grass around the entrance to Augusta National is pristine. It always is. In the suburbs which circle the home of the Masters, though, it is a different picture. Fractured trees sprawl across gardens. Rubbles of wood and brick stack high. Homes remain shattered. So do lives. When Rory McIlroy and the world's best golfers arrived in Augusta this week, along with an estimated 200,000 fans, the devastation caused by one of the United States' deadliest natural disasters was laid bare before them. In September, Hurricane Helene hit the south-eastern States - leaving death and destruction in its wake. Augusta, nicknamed 'The Garden City' because of its natural greenery, felt its mighty force. The residents are still dealing with the effects. \"There were multiple hours of 80mph winds which laid all of the forest down,\" lifelong Augusta resident Tonya Bonitatibus told BBC Sport. \"A lot of trees fell on top of houses and crushed cars â I lost my truck. But I was a lucky one.\" When Helene reached the American coast, it brought extreme winds, numerous tornadoes and flooding across several states.  According to the National Hurricane Center, Helene is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States, including at least 175 direct deaths. It was the deadliest hurricane in the US since Katrina in 2005. Florida, on the south-eastern frontier, bore the brunt of the force. But Helene quickly headed further north, engulfing South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. Augusta, which is the third most populous city in Georgia, was attacked by gusts of wind which reached 100mph through the night of 26 September - with stark consequences. \"Helene's winds were responsible for killing 11 people - all from trees falling onto homes in the greater Augusta area,\" a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center told BBC Sport. \"At least 362 homes and buildings were destroyed, while 3,000 others suffered major damage, and 3,500 others experienced minor to moderate damage.\" Augusta officials say almost 17,000 fallen trees have been removed from the city Residents living close to Augusta National had to leave their homes. Thousands were left without electricity and water. Joseph Crosby, his wife Kasey and their three children still cannot live in their storm damaged home, about five miles from the iconic course. He recalls watching a mature Ash tree, which he estimates had grown over 60 feet tall, being \"blown around like a rag doll\". \"I think your brain compartmentalises what you're going through,\" Joseph recalls of the night itself. \"All you think of at that moment is just survival and keeping your kids safe.  \"I just remember thinking if the tree came down on our house or something were to happen, would my kids be OK?\" The Crosby family home is among 1,695 properties damaged in the city of Augusta. City officials estimate the cost of residential losses has reached $282m (Â£220m). \"Folks here are resilient but this won't soon be forgotten. It reminds one how frail and furious nature can be,\" local journalist Joe Kovac told BBC Sport.  Augusta National Golf Club was not as badly affected as the suburbs nearby. But it did not escape.  \"After the storm when you rode around Augusta National, on Washington Road, the pile of trees was above your car for mile after mile,\" said Bonitatibus. Trees came down in their hundreds on the famed course, damaging one of golf's most famous greens on the par-three 16th. Walking the course now is a lighter, less claustrophobic experience.   You can see through wooded areas that previously screened individual holes and made them their own isolated stations. The separation of the ninth and first fairways is less cluttered.  Coming down the 11th hole it is possible to see into the neighbouring Augusta Country Club course. The wooded area to the right of the newly-laid 16th green will have fewer shadows when the world's best golfers begin their challenge for the famous Green Jacket on Thursday.   Speaking in January, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley said: \"As far as the golf course goes, it's in spectacular condition. \"We had minor damage to the course, the playing surfaces themselves, but we were able to get that back in shape. \"I don't think you're going to see any difference in the condition for the Masters this year.\" Kovac, who recently wrote a vivid account of the city's recovery process,, external agreed. \"I was struck by how emerald-green it is, at least the periphery. It is as if the grass never flinched,\" said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter. \"The kerbside lawn around the course perimeter looks manicured to the hilt. Only regular patrons will really notice trees are missing. \"But further into the miles of neighbourhoods ringing the National one cannot help but see the wreckage and its remains.\" Driving around Augusta, it does not take much to notice the roadsides still populated by fallen trees - oaks, ash and giant pines.  Long established homes bear scars of severe roof damage, much of it protected only by the flimsy tarpaulins. Life has been dominated recently by the need to join lengthy queues for construction and repair workers.  \"It's been a journey, just rebuilding. It's been really neat to see the community come together in a town like this,\" said Kasey Crosby. \"We've heard lots of stories of neighbours helping each other. \"Cutting neighbours out of their driveways so they can get their cars out and get to work, or to get to the grocery store.  \"People are pulling together, helping one another with chainsaws and just showing up.\" Augusta is described by its government as a 'centre of medicine, manufacturing, and military'.  However, its job market has long been unstable and the city is ranked among the neediest in the US. In December 2023, local newspaper, the Augusta Chronicle, reported it was ranked the nation's fifth worst city for economic well-being. Child poverty, food insecurity and unemployment rates were highlighted as particular problems. Blue tarpaulin covering the roofs of Augusta houses is a common sight  Augusta National, which stumped up $20m (Â£15.8m) in Masters prize money last year, is well aware of its privilege. In the aftermath of Helene, the club provided $5m of financial support to the relief fund. Bonitatibus, a riverkeeper who looks after the Savannah waterway, says the aid had a \"huge\" impact and reinforced Augusta National's philanthropic role in the community. The money helped provide food, water, laundry, showers and counselling services. Bonitatibus estimates the city is about \"60%\" through its recovery, although fears the environmental impact will last for \"many, many years\". \"We have things we need to shift as a community so when the next storm comes we're more prepared,\" she said. \"In terms of planting trees again, that's a couple of generations. We lost a 100-year-old on our property.\" Masters week, which has been held in Augusta since 1934, has long been one of the biggest economic drivers in the city. Last year, Forbes reported it contributes an estimated $120m (Â£94m) annually., external A hefty percentage of the 200,000 population rent out their homes - and land - for players, patrons and the media to lay their heads. Given the devastation, this Masters week holds extra significance and will provide a much-needed financial injection for the thousands affected. Many have been hanging on, forlorn and frustrated, in the hope of a positive answer from insurance companies deluged by desperate claims. \"The Masters is definitely the time when we put our best foot forward â and we're doing that again,\" said Bonitatibus. \"We're happy it is here â thank goodness, we need the proper cash. This is a huge opportunity for us to get back right.\"",

They are — and that’s kind of the point. ﻿For more than a week, TikTok users have been debating whether all New York City influencers are the same. They are — and that’s kind of the point. by  Mia Sato TikTok’s curse or blessing, depending on how you look at it, is that any video made by any random person can get millions of views without much rhyme or reason. Thousands of comments flood in, people make reaction videos, your random thoughts are referenced as gospel, and the TikTok content machine starts to whir.  If you’re of a certain demographic with certain interests — namely lifestyle, beauty, fashion, and New York City — you’ve probably already seen this viral 43-second clip that has spiraled into a full-blown Discourse Cycle. Earlier this month, a TikTok user, who had 90 followers at the time, posted a video that cut right to the chase: “All right guys, I’m just going to say it: I hate all of the New York influencers. I think they’re boring as fuck, and I think they’re all carbon copies of one another,” the creator, @martinifeeny, says. The biggest influencers based in New York wear and buy the same things, she goes on to say, and they’re all thin and pretty but boring. In the comments, people called out the specific boutique fitness classes and skincare routines that appear to form the lion’s share of the influencers’ hobbies; some made the point that following a more diverse set of influencers would solve the problem entirely. Some influencers — apparently feeling personally attacked — made (and deleted) videos responding to the original one. You do not need to know the specific influencers enmeshed in the discussion (though Vulture has a good run down), live in New York, or even follow influencers to get the point. Social media is awash in people who look, sound, and act like their peers, often for money. This “drama” is narrowly focused on one type of person, but it is a microcosm of the internet writ large: the most visible content online is just a slightly different version of something else. In November, I wrote a story that might be the galaxy-brain version of the “influencers are boring” discourse — the saga of two young women so similar to one another that there’s a legal battle being waged to try and figure out if one of them broke the law. The two influencers are not based in New York, but if they were, they might be wrapped up in the current TikTok firestorm. In lay terms, their content style is best described as “basic.” They almost exclusively promote products purchased on Amazon, which itself lacks any substance and style so it can appeal to the widest customer base possible. The lawsuit claims that one influencer copied another’s very standard look so closely that she infringed on the plaintiff’s copyright and trade dress. There’s a lot to be said about how and why certain people are elevated to bona fide capital-I Influencer status. Some of it has to do with who you are — your race, class, gender, disability status, and other aspects can push your career along or make it more difficult to ascend. The “New York City” designation is mostly a branding exercise. As other content creators have pointed out, the biggest influencers based in the city do not engage with their surroundings beyond going to restaurants, bars, and shopping. The city is a backdrop for selling their audiences clothing, home decor, makeup, and other consumables. Many of the women in this archetype are clients of the same talent manager who helps them secure sponsored content deals and advertising campaigns with a roster of brands.  As I detailed in my story about the Amazon influencers, the platforms these content creators have hitched their wagons to demand replicability; the algorithms reward palatable and ideologically neutral content that fits into established genres. It is easier to make videos that look like those of your peers than it is to create an entirely new format. As an influencer, you are making content that must be understandable to recommendation systems, and if the number goes up when you make boring videos, then that’s all the signal you need to keep doing the same thing over and over. If it feels like everyone is the same, it’s because they are all milking the same formula that social media platforms tell them is working. It’s like the MrBeast YouTube thumbnail strategy, but for women in their 20s, whose brand revolves around them posting videos from the West Village.  Our digital feeds will continue to get more monotonous, not less Platforms pushing user behavior (and creativity) toward a dull average has become a defining characteristic of the current state of the internet. Before you notice the repetition on TikTok, you’re more likely to see this same thing happen with websites you visit — there’s a reason all recipe sites look the same, why every article you click on suddenly has subheads and author bios. In this example, it’s Google setting the conditions for engagement, and a captive audience of SEO workers who jump through hoops to make sure their sites are visible in search. When your life depends on people seeing and engaging with your article, TikTok video, Instagram Reel, there’s little reason to stray from what catches on, and often what travels the most is painfully, mind-numbingly average. The fact that technology companies promise the next frontier of human creation is AI — which are, by definition, average generators — suggests that our digital feeds will continue to get more monotonous, not less. Is it any surprise then that this crop of New York women building influencer careers and businesses all seem the same? It’s not necessarily that they, as people, are indistinguishable. But they are hired by the same brands to produce the same videos to appeal to the same potential customers, and this cycle repeats until someone new but similarly fitting comes along and shifts the goalposts slightly.  Ultimately, this debate over carbon copy influencers fundamentally misunderstands two things. One is what these influencers are doing when they post. Their job is first and foremost in advertising — how many different ways can you sell a handbag? The second mistake is assuming the facsimiles are an anomaly of life online — that NYC influencers are boring because they’re boring people, that engaging user interest requires content to be interesting, or that there was any other possible outcome given the incentives and basic technological capacities and restrictions at play.  But this proliferation of look-alike, sound-alike, and feel-alike women isn’t a bug. It’s a feature.

    "full_content": "King Charles III has sent his condolences to the people of Myanmar after Friday's deadly earthquake. In a message on social media, King Charles spoke of the shock and sadness he and the Queen felt about the earthquake, which killed more than 1,600 people. He sent their \"deepest possible sympathy\" to those who had lost loved ones, homes or livelihoods.  The King is understood to be staying at his Highgrove estate after spending time in hospital earlier this week due to side effects from his cancer treatment. The 7.7-magnitude quake killed hundreds at the epicentre near Mandalay, Myanmar. Its powerful effects could be felt hundreds of miles away in Thai capital Bangkok, as well as in China and India. There have been reports of widespread devastation in the Saigaing region and in Mandalay, where buildings have been flattened and temple spires toppled. Officials in Myanmar say more than 1,600 have died so far, with another 2,376 injured. The UK Foreign Office said it would send £10 million in humanitarian aid to Myanmar to support the response \"in the hardest hit areas of the earthquake\".  Charles wrote: \"My wife and I were most dreadfully shocked and saddened to learn of the devastating earthquake in Myanmar, with its tragic loss of life and appalling damage to homes, buildings and livelihoods, not to mention the destruction of sacred pagodas, monasteries and other places of worship. \"I know that the people of Myanmar continue to endure so much hardship and tragedy in your lives, and I have long admired your extraordinary resilience and spirit.\" He added: \"At this most difficult and heartbreaking of times, my wife and I send our deepest possible sympathy to all those who have suffered the profound tragedy of losing their loved ones, their homes and their precious livelihoods.\" The King, 76, cancelled a trip to Birmingham on Friday on medical advice, Buckingham Palace said. He had spent a short time in hospital the previous day.  He left Clarence House, his London residence, on Friday morning to travel to his Gloucestershire estate.  His cancer diagnosis was announced in February 2024. The Palace has not said what type of cancer he has, nor what the recent side effects were.",

In a post on Wednesday, CEO Sam Altman admitted that the image-generation tool is more popular than he expected, adding that “rollout to our free tier is unfortunately going to be delayed for awhile.” OpenAI only just added image generation capabilities to ChatGPT on Tuesday, allowing users to create images directly within the app using the company’s reasoning model, GPT-4o. Since its launch, users have flooded social media feeds with photos transformed into images generated in the style of Studio Ghibli, a trend that even Altman has gotten in on. GPT-4o comes with improvements to text rendering and uses “an autoregressive approach” to image generation, which means it generates an image from left to right and top to bottom instead of all at the same time.

    "full_content": "During Donald Trump’s first term, Steve Bannon explicitly laid out what the administration’s strategy would be to get things done: “flood the zone with shit.” The theory is pretty simple: throw out as much bullshit as possible—knowing that there is only so much attention, outrage, and resistance that people can muster—and take wins while everyone else takes the bait. It’s not hard to see that this approach has been kicked into hyperdrive during the first months of Trump’s second term, facilitated in no small part by Trump-backer and “first buddy” Elon Musk turning Twitter into a cesspool of distraction, disinformation, and disorientation. In what should be an extremely information-rich environment, it’s become near-impossible to separate signal from noise. Luckily, some fine folks are keeping their eyes on the ball so that we don’t all fall victim to the high-stakes shell game. First up, there is the Project 2025 Tracker. Started as a spreadsheet maintained by two Redditors, the project has grown into a larger resource designed to keep tabs on the Trump administration’s progress in implementing the plans laid out in Project 2025—a 900-plus page blueprint for consolidating executive power and reshaping the government to serve a right-wing Christian Nationalist agenda. Project 2025 Tracker has broken out the policy recommendations of the Heritage Foundation’s guiding document, identifying them as goals of the administration and tracking its progress in actually accomplishing those efforts. Those goals are attached to specific agencies and are searchable in the project’s database, or you can track the overall progress of the administration’s efforts. So far, it’s going pretty well for them: Project 2025 Tracker estimates that Trump and his team have already accomplished nearly 40% of the goals established by Project 2025. As for Musk’s attempts to flood the zone, journalist Judd Legum of Popular Information and Musk Watch has launched a new project called DOGE Tracker—an audit for the pseudo-agency that claims to be auditing the federal government but somehow keeps having to revise its own numbers. DOGE Tracker has a simple premise: don’t take Elon Musk at his word. Instead, the project digs into DOGE’s claimed savings, the actual itemized cuts that DOGE has bothered to record, and actual verifiable canceled funding. You’ll be shocked (well, no, you wouldn’t) to hear that these numbers don’t add up. According to DOGE Tracker, the department has claimed to achieve $105 billion in savings as of March 12, 2025, but has only documented $29.9 billion of it—and just $8.6 billion in savings can actually be verified. That means that Musk and his crew have overstated what they have saved the country by about 92%. We’re barely two months into this iteration of the Trump presidency. Things are not going to slow down. The one will continue to be flooded. Use these tools to filter out the bullshit and pay attention to what matters. \nDOGEDonald TrumpElon Muskproject 2025Trump administration  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Tesla's presentation last year for a Cybercab gave sci-fi dystopia vibes that drew concern from Alcon Entertainment.\n         \n          What seems at first like a logical move to modernize the government's archives may in fact be an ill-advised decision.\n         \n          China's response to tariffs could hit Hollywood.\n         \n          Navarro said Musk wasn't a manufacturer of cars, just an \"assembler.\"\n         \n          The billionaire class stands to lose more than the average American from Trump's dumb trade war.\n         \n          Our reality just keeps getting stupider.",

    "full_content": "Myanmar's military has announced a temporary ceasefire to speed up relief and reconstruction efforts following last week's devastating earthquake. In a statement, the ruling junta's State Administration Council said the deal would be in effect from 2 April to 22 April. Earlier this week, rebel groups fighting the military unilaterally declared a ceasefire to support relief efforts - the military had refused to do the same until Wednesday's announcement. At least 2,886 people are now known to have been killed after the magnitude- 7.7 earthquake struck last Friday. Hundreds of people are still missing. The earthquake was also felt hundreds of miles away in neighbouring countries like Thailand, where the death toll currently stands at 21. Myanmar has been gripped by violence amid a civil war between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. On Tuesday night, Myanmar's military opened fire at a Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies. The Ta'ang National Liberation Army, an armed rebel group, said that military troops shot at the convoy of nine vehicles with machine guns in eastern Shan State.  The convoy was en route to Mandalay, the hard-hit city near the epicentre of the earthquake. No injuries have been reported. The junta, which said it was investigating the incident, denied shooting directly at the vehicles. It said troops fired shots into the air after the convoy did not stop, despite it being signalled to do so. China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that its rescue team and supplies were safe, adding that it hoped \"all factions and parties in Myanmar will prioritize earthquake relief efforts\". Myanmar's humanitarian crisis has worsened significantly after last week's earthquake. The actual death toll is believed to be much higher than the official figures provided by the junta. Multiple international aid agencies and foreign governments have dispatched personnel and supplies to quake-hit regions. A military spokesperson on Wednesday said troops saw the aid convoy coming from Naungcho township on Tuesday night, with vehicles sporting Chinese stickers and Myanmar number plates, but had not been given prior notice of the vehicles' movement. \"When we saw the convoy, we stopped it. But they continued. We opened fire from about 200m away, but they didn't stop,\" he said.  \"At about 100m away, we fired three shots in the air, after which the vehicles turned back towards Naungcho.\" China's Blue Sky Rescue Team, which has been providing rescue support in Mandalay, had been given a security cover when they travelled through this route, the spokesperson said. He added that when international agencies want to give aid, they need to inform the Myanmar government. The TNLA, which was escorting the Red Cross convoy, said they had informed the military council about going to Mandalay. After retreating to Naungcho, they would be continuing their journey, the group said in a statement.",

    "full_content": "Myanmar's military junta has continued to bomb parts of the war-torn country following the major earthquake there, which has killed more than 1,600 people. The UN has described the attacks as \"completely outrageous and unacceptable\". Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews told the BBC that it was \"nothing short of incredible\" that the military was continuing to \"drop bombs when you are trying to rescue people\" after the earthquake. He called on the military regime, which seized power in a coup nearly four years ago to stop all military operations. \"Anyone who has influence on the military needs to step up the pressure and make it very clear that this is not acceptable,\" he said. \"I'm calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations,\" he added. BBC Burmese confirmed that seven people had been killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake had struck. Pro-democracy rebel groups that are fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the north-western Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border. The National Unity Government (NUG), which represents the ousted civilian administration, said in a statement that its armed forces would begin a two-week pause in \"offensive military operations, except for defensive actions\" in areas affected by the earthquake, from Sunday. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Sagaing was also felt in neighbouring countries. It was followed by reports of destruction coming from nearby Mandalay - Myanmar's second largest city - as well as the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, which is more than 150 miles (241km) away.  The junta says 1,644 people are known to have died and many more are believed to be trapped under rubble. The quake comes after four years of civil war in Myanmar that followed a military coup in 2021. The coup triggered huge protests, with thousands taking to the streets daily, demanding the restoration of civilian rule. What initially began as a civil disobedience campaign soon evolved into a widespread insurgency involving pro-democracy and ethnic rebel groups - which eventually sparked an all-out civil war. Four years on, violent fighting has continued between the military on the one hand, and ethnic armies and armed resistance groups on the other. The junta, which has suffered continual and humiliating defeats and lost vast swathes of territory, is increasingly relying on air attacks to crush resistance to its rule. Large parts of the Sagaing region, the epicentre of the earthquake, are now under the control of pro-democracy resistance groups. A BBC investigation revealed that nearly four years after seizing power in a coup, the military now controls less than a quarter of the country. The investigation revealed that ethnic armies and a patchwork of resistance groups now control 42% of the country's land mass, while much of the remaining area remains contested. It's in aerial combat that the military regime has the upper hand. Resistance groups lack the capacity to fight back in the air. The military has a history of carrying out indiscriminate aerial bombardments that have destroyed schools, monasteries, churches, and hospitals. In one of the deadliest airstrikes, more than 170 people were killed, including many women and children. The UN body investigating human rights violations in the country has warned that the military junta is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity against its own people. The military's aerial warfare is being sustained by continued support from Russia and China. Despite UN calls for an arms embargo in response to the coup, both China and Russia have sold the junta sophisticated attack jets and provided training on how to use it. Russia and China have also now sent aid and rescue teams into Myanmar. But UK-based Burmese rights activist Julie Khine said: \"It's hard to trust the sympathy now, when they're also the same countries supplying the military junta with deadly weapons used to kill our innocent civilians.\" There is also widespread concern that the military will use aid as a weapon in the civil war. Myanmar's military has a longstanding practice of denying aid to areas where resistance groups are active. The UN's Tom Andrews told the BBC that during past relief efforts, the military  blocked aid and arrested aid workers. \"What we know from past humanitarian disasters, natural disasters, is that the junta does not reveal the truth. It also has a habit of blocking humanitarian aid from getting to where it is most needed,\" he said. \"They weaponise this aid. They send it to those areas that they have control of and they deny it to areas that they do not.  \"So you have areas in which the most acute needs exist and you have literally aid trying to get in, trucks blocking the way, people being arrested and that has been the pattern of their response to natural disasters in the past. \"I'm afraid I'm fully expecting that that will be the case with this disaster.\"",

    "full_content": "About 15 children's backpacks lie torn apart in the rubble - pink, blue and orange bags with books spilling out of them. Spiderman toys and letters of the alphabet are scattered among broken chairs, tables and garden slides at the remains of this preschool destroyed by the huge earthquake that hit Myanmar on Friday. It is in the town of Kyaukse, about 40km (25 miles) south of Mandalay, one of the areas hit hardest by the 7.7 magnitude quake that killed at least 2,000 people. Kywe Nyein, 71, weeps as he explains that his family are preparing to hold the funeral of his five-year-old granddaughter, Thet Hter San. He says her mother was having lunch when the devastating earthquake began. She ran to the school, but the building had collapsed completely. The little girl's body was found about three hours later. \"Fortunately, we got our beloved's body intact, in one piece,\" he says. Locals say there were about 70 children, aged between two and seven, at the school on Friday, learning happily. But now there is little left except a pile of bricks, concrete and iron rods. The school says 12 children and a teacher died, but locals believe the number is at least 40 - that is how many were in the downstairs section that collapsed. Residents and parents are distraught. People say the whole town came to help with the rescue work and several bodies were retrieved on Friday. They describe mothers crying and calling out the names of their children long into the night. Now, three days later, the site is quiet. People look at me with grief etched on their faces. Aid groups are warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, with hospitals damaged and overwhelmed, though the full scale of devastation is still emerging. Before we arrived in Kyaukse, we had been in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. The worst-hit area we saw there was a building that had been residential quarters for civil servants. The whole ground floor had collapsed, leaving the three upper floors still standing on top of it. There were traces of blood in the rubble. The intense stench suggested many people had died there, but there was no sign of rescue work. A group of policemen were loading furniture and household goods on to trucks, and appeared to be trying to salvage what was still useable. The police officer in charge would not give us an interview, though we were allowed to film for a while. We could see people mourning and desolate, but they did not want to speak to the media, fearing reprisals from the military government. We were left with so many questions. How many people were under the rubble? Could any of them still be alive? Why was there no rescue work, even to retrieve the bodies of the dead? Just 10 minutes' drive away, we had visited the capital's largest hospital - known here as the \"1,000-bed hospital\". The roof of the emergency room had collapsed. At the entrance, a sign saying \"Emergency Department\" in English lay on the ground. There were six military medical trucks and several tents outside, where patients evacuated from the hospital were being cared for. The tents were being sprayed with water to give those inside some relief from the intense heat. It looked like there were about 200 injured people there, some with bloodied heads, others with broken limbs. We saw an official angrily reprimanding staff about other colleagues who had not turned up to work during the emergency. I realised the man was the minister for health, Dr Thet Khaing Win, and approached him for an interview but he curtly rejected my request. On the route into the city, people sat clustered under trees on the central reservation of the highway, trying to get some relief from the hot sun. It is the hottest time of year - it must have been close to 40C - but they were afraid to be inside buildings because of the continuing aftershocks. We had set out on our journey to the earthquake zone at 4am on Sunday morning from Yangon, about 600 km (370 miles) south of Mandalay. The road was pitch black, with no street lights. After more than three hours' driving, we saw a team of about 20 rescue workers in orange uniforms, with logos on their vests showing they had come from Hong Kong. We started to find cracks in the roads as we drove north. The route normally has several checkpoints, but we had travelled for 185km (115 miles) before we saw one. A lone police officer told us the road ahead was closed because of a broken bridge, and showed us a diversion. We had hoped to reach Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, by Sunday night. But the diversion, and problems with our car in the heat, made that impossible. A day later, we have finally reached the city. It is in complete darkness, with no street lights on and homes without power or running water. We are anxious about what we will find here when morning comes.",

    "full_content": "As California recovers from devastating wildfires and hurricane season fast approaches, President Donald Trump and the White House DOGE team are slashing the workforce at the federal agency responsible for monitoring extreme weather. Business Insider spoke to more than a dozen current and former employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who said that staff and policy changes were making their day-to-day jobs more challenging. They worried about how the upheaval would affect Americans' safety — especially as hurricane and tornado seasons rapidly approach. Andrew Hazelton, a former NOAA hurricane modeler who was fired in February alongside other probationary employees, was blunt: If forecasts and hurricane warnings go downhill, he told BI, \"we could see loss of life as a result.\" The agency's reach extends across the country and the globe. Besides its work on extreme climate conditions, NOAA provides the data that powers the weather app on your phone, alerts pilots to turbulence, and helps farmers know when to plant to keep American agriculture rolling. \"It really, truly affects every single American every day,\" a former probationary employee said. (Some employees we spoke to asked to remain anonymous.) Before Trump took office in January, NOAA employed around 12,430 people, according to a congressional report. More than 1,000 employees have departed through layoffs or buyouts, said JoAnn Becker, the president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union representing NOAA employees. More than 600 were terminated in February and about 500 took the administration's buyout offer, according to previous reporting. Between the uncertain future for probationary employees, voluntary early retirements and buyouts, and Trump's ongoing government-wide reduction-in-force effort, the agency may shrink further. \"We would like to just go on and do our jobs and save people's lives,\" an employee at the National Weather Service, a department within NOAA, said. Outside of staffing cuts, some employees said stricter rules around travel and expense budgets have made it difficult to do the jobs that are vital to protecting people from natural disasters. Expiration dates for contracts marked as \"urgent\" are also coming up soon, according to internal documents viewed by BI. An \"extensive process was conducted to ensure that mission-critical functions to fulfill NOAA's statutory responsibilities weren't compromised,\" a Trump administration spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson declined to provide additional details about the process. Susan Buchanan, a NOAA spokeswoman, said that the agency remains dedicated to its mission. A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, did not respond to a request for comment from BI. For those who remain, the show must go on, even as resources and staff dwindle. \"We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people,\" a NOAA employee said. \"Eventually one of them is probably going to fall.\" Several people who spoke to BI expressed unease over how the staffing cuts and operational changes at NOAA could affect the aviation industry. Though flying remains the safest mode of transportation, a National Weather Service employee who's worked at the agency for more than a decade said that if the turmoil at the agency continues long term, \"I don't know if I'd trust getting on a plane.\" NOAA assists with running aviation-specific weather models for pilots, helping them track things like turbulence. Its data \"ripples right through the whole system,\" Brad Colman, the former president of the American Meteorological Society, said. \"If systems are degraded, a turbulence forecast may go down in quality, and uncertainty is increased,\" Colman said. \"There's more exposure, more risk.\" A spokesperson for the Airline Dispatchers Federation told BI in an email that NOAA provides dispatchers with \"essential tools,\" including turbulence, wind, and weather forecasts. \"Virtually all\" of the weather data for domestic flights comes from NOAA, and its data is \"fundamental\" to daily operations, the spokesperson said. The organization hasn't yet noticed operational impacts but warned that \"even subtle degradations could affect our operations.\" The Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment. Meteorologists who work for airlines receive foundational data from NOAA to develop their forecasts, the spokesperson added, noting that smaller airlines will likely face more challenges if NOAA's data degrades — potentially creating a disparity in safety across the industry. Or as Tom Di Liberto, a former public affairs official and climate scientist who was fired in February, put it: \"There's a reason why a lot of weather forecast offices are close by or at a major airport.\" Staffers affected by the terminations weren't just at NOAA's headquarters in Maryland; they were stationed in regional offices across the country. One office in Alaska stopped launching daily weather balloons to collect data for forecasts, Larry Hubble, an upper air program manager in the state, said. On March 20, the National Weather Service temporarily suspended weather balloon launches at offices in Nebraska and South Dakota, while seven other sites are scaling back to one launch a day instead of two because of staffing shortages. Other instruments, like radars on commercial aircraft and satellites, also collect data. The NWS employee of more than a decade said that balloons are one of the most accurate methods of weather measurement, and if they're scaled back, \"they're going to start seeing the degradation of the models and the forecast is going to lose its accuracy.\" \"If you degrade our capabilities, our warnings get weaker and people and property get compromised,\" a NOAA employee told BI. \"Damages are going to increase, people are not going to get out of harm's way, and they're going to die.\" The Government and Accountability Office said in a March report that staffing shortages and aircraft maintenance problems in recent years had already hampered hurricane hunters' ability to perform their jobs — well before DOGE ever came knocking on doors. The changes at NOAA will likely ripple across the private sector, affecting a range of industries, some employees told BI. The reinsurance industry, for example, uses NOAA data to help confirm damages from natural disasters and dole out funds. Construction workers rely on NOAA data to figure out where to build new projects. The economic implications are vast — NOAA's products impact more than one-third of the country's GDP, according to the agency's website. \"If you take out NOAA, the private sector cannot do what NOAA does,\" Di Liberto said. The agency operates thousands of weather balloons, hundreds of buoys, 10 airplanes, and 18 satellites and makes that information accessible to the entire public — not just those who can pay for it. The spokesperson from the Airline Dispatchers Federation said that private weather companies provide helpful supplemental services, but they ultimately rely on NOAA's raw data. \"There is simply no replacement for NOAA's comprehensive data collection infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said.

The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar Friday has climbed to more than 2,000, and officials say they expect that number to rise even further. The search for those still buried under the rubble, meanwhile, continues. One woman was pulled out of the wreckage of a 12-story apartment building in Mandalay alive. Beneath the historic temples of Mandalay, the destructive power of Myanmar's worst earthquake in a century is clear to see. The country's second-largest city bore the full force of the disaster. At the Sky Villa condominium, rescue workers were digging through the rubble with their hands. Ninety people were feared to be trapped. The building housed apartments and a wedding venue, but its 12 stories now resemble six after it pancaked in seconds. The first shipments of international aid arrived at the airport in the former capital, Yangon. They came from neighboring China and  India and included search and rescue and medical teams, as well as blankets, and other provisions.  \n                Indian and Myanmar rescuers carry a dead

Relief efforts are focused on Myanmar, where the estimated death toll rose to 1,644 by Sunday afternoon. The number of dead from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake is expected to increase, while the number of injured was at 3,408 and the missing figure rose was 139 on Sunday. The earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17. While food, medicine and other vital supplies have reached Myanmar, a report issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said rescue efforts have been hampered by a severe shortage of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicine and tents to house health workers. \"We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,\" said Mohammed Riyas, the IRC's Myanmar director. Here is a look at some of the contributions in supplies, personnel and monetary support and the nations and groups providing assistance: On Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay. China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits, generators, earthquake detectors and drones while pledging around $13.8 million in emergency aid. Hong Kong on Saturday dispatched 51 search-and-rescue personnel including firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs. The group brought 9 tons (18,000 pounds) of equipment including life detectors and an automatic satellite tracking antenna system, according to a statement on the Hong Kong government's website. The Hong Kong government also will set aside HK$30 million ($3.9 million) from its Disaster Relief Fund to help Myanmar victims. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, Myanmar's second-largest city, and Russia's Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team that includes specialists in infectious diseases, resuscitation, traumatology and psychology, as well as search and rescue teams with canine units and devices that can search in rubble with depths as much as 4.5 meters (14.7 feet). Two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday brought in a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who traveled north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment center, the country's Foreign Ministry said. India previously said it planned to send five aircrafts and four ships with relief supplies including rescue team and medical teams. Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country would send 50 personnel to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas. South Korea said it will provide $2 million in humanitarian aid through international organizations. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a post on X that his government would support relief efforts \"via the International Red Cross Movement.\" The European Commission said Friday it would release 2.5 million euros ($2.7 million) in initial emergency assistance to assist with earthquake relief, bringing the European Union's total humanitarian aid for Myanmar to more than €35 million ($37.8 million) this year. Ireland announced Saturday the government would provide an aid package of €6 million ($6.49 million) with €3 million ($3.2 million) to support the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Myanmar Red Cross Society, €1.5 million ($1.6 million) each to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund and U.N. Refugee Agency Joint Response Plan. President Donald Trump said Friday the U.S. would help with the response, but some experts were concerned about the promised effort given his administration's deep cuts in foreign assistance. The U.N. humanitarian affairs office said it has mobilized with other groups and $5 million has been allocated from a Central Emergency Response Fund for \"life-saving assistance.\" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies released 2 million Swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to support the organization's work in Myanmar, Jagan Chapagain, the organization's secretary general and CEO, said in a social media post Sunday. Cara Bragg, the Yangon-based manager of Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar, said relief efforts have largely consisted of local volunteers trying to find loved ones. Despite the influx of countries sending search and rescue teams, \"hospitals are really struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, there's a shortage of medical supplies, and people are struggling to find food and clean water,\" Bragg said.",

The surprise announcement by military leaders who also head the unelected government came late Wednesday on state television MRTV, which said the halt in fighting would run until April 22 to show compassion for people affected by Friday's quake. The announcement followed unilateral temporary ceasefires announced by armed resistance groups opposed to military rule, and the military warned that those groups must refrain from attacking the state and regrouping, or else face \"necessary\" measures. The resistance forces have also reserved the right to fight in self-defense. Earlier Wednesday, rescuers pulled two men alive from the ruins of a hotel in Myanmar's capital, a third from a guesthouse in another city, and another in the country's second city, Mandalay, five days after the quake. But most teams were finding only bodies. The quake hit midday Friday, toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. The death toll rose to 3,003 on Wednesday, with more than 4,500 people injured, MRTV reported. Local reports suggest much higher figures. The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis due to Myanmar's civil war. More than 3 million people had been displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million were in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations. In the capital, Naypyitaw, a team of Turkish and local rescue workers used an endoscopic camera to locate Naing Lin Tun on a lower floor of the damaged hotel where he worked. They pulled him gingerly through a hole jackhammered through a floor and loaded him on to a gurney nearly 108 hours after he was first trapped. Shirtless and covered in dust, he appeared weak but conscious in a video released by the local fire department, as he was fitted with an IV drip and taken away. State-run MRTV reported later in the day that another man was saved from the same building, more than 121 hours after the quake struck. Both were age 26. \n                Buddhist novice monks sit under temporary shelter near a road, in the aftermath of Friday's earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    AP/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Another man, a 47-year-old primary school principal, was rescued by a team of Malaysian and local crews from a collapsed guesthouse in the Sagaing township, near the epicenter of the earthquake close to Myanmar's second-largest city, Mandalay, where a fourth rescue was reported Wednesday night. The earthquake also rocked neighboring Thailand, causing the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok. One body was removed from the rubble early Wednesday, raising the death total in Bangkok to 22 with 35 injured, primarily at the construction site. Myanmar's military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance. Ceasefires had been announced earlier this week by the People's Defense Force, which is the armed wing of the shadow opposition National Unity Government, and the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a trio of ethnic minority guerrilla armies. \n                Local residents ride motorbikes near damaged buildings in the aftermath of Friday's earthquake, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    AP/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n That had put pressure on the military government to follow suit, said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies. It's too early to say whether a pause in fighting could lead to something longer lasting, he said. \"It would require very deft and active diplomacy to transform a humanitarian pause into something more lasting. And that's not guaranteed,\" Morgans said. The military government was particularly vulnerable to bad publicity this week because its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was expected for a high-profile visit to a regional conference in the Thai capital Thursday. It will be his first to a country other than his government's main supporters and backers — China, Russia and Russia ally Belarus — since he attended another regional meeting in Indonesia in 2021. Min Aung Hlaing and other senior leaders are shunned and sanctioned by many Western countries for their 2021 takeover and human rights abuses as they try to crush the resistance to their rule. Before Wednesday's ceasefire announcement, an opposition militia belonging to the Brotherhood Alliance reported that the military fired on a relief convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross vehicles late Tuesday in the northern part of Shan state. The Ta'ang National Liberation Army said that the Chinese Red Cross was bringing supplies to Mandalay and had reported its route to the military. But Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the military government, said that the convoy hadn't notified authorities of its route ahead of time, MRTV reported. While not mentioning the Red Cross, he said that security forces had fired into the air to deter a convoy that refused to stop. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun didn't comment on the attack. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was looking into the matter. Countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organizations with the monumental task ahead, while also sending in specialist search and rescue teams and setting up field hospitals. India and China, both neighbors of Myanmar that compete for influence there, have been especially quick and generous with assistance. Multiple other countries have sent teams, including Turkey, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. \n                In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Chinese rescuers move a survivor out from a collapsed building in the aftermath of an earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Cai Yang/Xinhua via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The U.S. government has pledged $2 million in emergency aid and sent a three-person team to assess how best to respond given drastic cuts to U.S. foreign assistance. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that continuing aftershocks are complicating humanitarian response efforts. In Mandalay City, many people are completely cut off from electricity and running water. \"People affected continue to need urgent healthcare and medical supplies, safe drinking water, food and other critical items,\" Dujarric said. \"Tents and temporary shelter are needed, as well as latrines and other hygiene items, to prevent disease outbreaks.\" Most of the details so far have come from Mandalay, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake, and Naypyitaw, about 270 kilometers (165 miles) north of Mandalay. Many areas are without power, telephone or cellphone connections, and difficult to reach by road, but more reports are beginning to trickle in. In Singu township, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mandalay, 27 gold miners were killed in a cave-in, the independent Democratic Voice of Burma reported. In the area of Inle Lake, a popular tourist destination northeast of the capital, many people died when homes built on wooden stilts in the water collapsed in the earthquake, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported.",

    "full_content": "The National Weather Service is reducing the number of weather balloon launchesâand thus, the amount of data collected from American skiesâfollowing sweeping cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by the Trump White House. Hundreds of federal workers at NOAAâabout 10% of the workforceâwere fired on the last day of February, as the Trump administration continued its culling of federal funding across the sciences. âWeâre going to lose data because of this staffing,â said Michael Morgan, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and former NOAA administrator, in a press conference Monday. âAnd that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast.” According to a National Weather Service wire published late last week, weather balloon observations are now suspended out of Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, due to a lack of staffing. Inside Climate News reported that launches were also suspended in Kotzebue, Alaska. Typically, the NWS launches weather balloons twice each day from 100 sites across the country, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Basin. The radiosondes attached to those weather balloons collect information on a suite of factors that contribute to weather, including temperatures, dew points, humidity, barometric pressures, and wind speed and direction. A second NWS Public Information Statement said that weather balloon launches would be cut down to a single launch per day out of Aberdeen, South Dakota, Grand Junction, Colorado, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gaylord, Michigan, North Platte, Nebraska, and Riverton, Wyoming. âDoes it mean every single forecast is going to be poor?” Morgan added. “No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.â Similar views were espoused by NOAA meteorologist and hurricane hunter Andrew Hazelton, who spoke to Gizmodo last week as his employment status wended its way through the federal court system. Hazeltonâand many other federal employeesâhave been left in employment limbo afterÂ being laid off, but now reinstated, albeit not permitted to work. “Whenever thereâs a hurricane, better forecasts allow people to get outâor vice versa, if theyâre not going to be impacted, they donât have to close up their school or business,” Hazelton told Gizmodo. “Better forecasts save lives and money. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself.” Last month’s cost-cutting measures also reduced the workforce at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Park Service, among other agencies. It will take time to see the impacts of the layoffs across the board, and the same goes for the staffing shortages at NWS locations. The NWS Press Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Exactly how this diminished data will affect weather forecasts won’t be clear immediately, but what is clear is that the cuts will mean we have less information about what’s going on in our skies. \nBalloonDOGElayoffsNOAAWeather  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          What seems at first like a logical move to modernize the government's archives may in fact be an ill-advised decision.\n         \n          Navarro said Musk wasn't a manufacturer of cars, just an \"assembler.\"\n         \n          The Social Security Administration has been a target of Elon Musk over unproven allegations of rampant fraud.\n         \n          An already weakened agency workforce will be severely culled in the coming weeks, per DOGE's orders.\n         \n          The CDC is set to cut a third of its contracts spending within the next two weeksâthe latest bit of dismantling orchestrated by the Trump administration.\n         \n          \"Elon Musk should become Donald Trump's special envoy for midterm elections,\" said one Democratic Party leader.",

Of those tropical cyclones, nine are forecast to become hurricanes, with four of those expected to reach \"major\" hurricane strength. \n\nThat would mean a few more tropical storms and hurricanes than in an average year, yet slightly quieter conditions than those observed across the Atlantic basin last year. This time last year, researchers from CSU were warning of an \"extremely active\" hurricane season with nearly two dozen named tropical storms. The next month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released an aggressive forecast, warning the United States could face one of its worst hurricane seasons in two decades. \n\nThe forecast out Thursday underscores how warming oceans and cyclical patterns in storm activity have primed the Atlantic basin for what is now a decades-long string of frequent, above-normal -- but not necessarily hyperactive -- seasons, said Philip Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State and the forecast's lead author.",

On the 5th floor of her university dormitory building, she wasn't used to the rumbling sound coming from the lower floors. Then, the earthquake began. \"I realized there was a problem, and if I didn't get down soon, I wouldn't be able to escape anymore,\" she said. \"I thought, 'Am I going to survive?' \" Chit had experienced quakes in Myanmar before, but never on this scale. The temblor with a magnitude of 7.7, struck at around 12:50 p.m. local time (1:50 a.m. ET) on Friday. It has devastated large areas within Myanmar, and was felt in Thailand and China as well. State-run media reports that the death toll has now risen to over 1,600, with over 3,400 injured inside Myanmar. It is thought the death toll will continue to rise. \n                The map above shows the epicenter of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar.\n                \n                    \n                    Phil Holm/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The quake's epicenter, roughly 10 miles from the town of Sagaing in central Myanmar, is close to Myanmar's second most populated city, Mandalay. The damage there and in the surrounding regions has been extensive. Rushing down to the ground floor, Chit emerged onto the streets of Mandalay, now covered in dust. Videos shared on social media show wreckage on the streets, with multiple buildings collapsed. Another shows the Sagaing bridge, an important connecting point between Mandalay and the rest of Myanmar, destroyed. \"People are asking for help to rescue their family members from the fallen-down buildings. On the street, the people who could escape from dangerous conditions are sleeping on the empty ground,\" Chit said. John McGown, program director for Plan International, an NGO active in Myanmar, said, \"We have staff members who have family in Mandalay that weren't able to sleep inside their homes last night because of fear of tremors.\" Internet and phone lines were also cut in Mandalay, Sagaing, and in southern Shan state, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reported Saturday. Although some areas are now periodically reconnected, the disconnect initially left residents like Chit cut off from their families, unable to find out whether they had survived or not. In the face of the destruction, Myanmar's ruling military junta have made a rare request for humanitarian aid. On Friday, Russia said 120 rescue workers had been sent to Myanmar to assist in the search for victims caught in the rubble. China, meanwhile, has pledged to provide Myanmar with 100 million yuan ($13.8 million) in humanitarian aid and also sent teams to assist in relief efforts. President Trump on Friday said the U.S. would also help with the response. But, although countries around the world have pledged to send support, the quake has also made coordination of rescue efforts more difficult. Plan International's McGown told NPR that communication difficulties have made it impossible for teams from the organization to coordinate in real time as they enter the hardest hit areas. Damage to infrastructure has also slowed teams' efforts to reach certain towns. The quake has compounded existing issues within Myanmar. Since 2021, the country has been run by a military junta and been engaged in an ongoing civil war that has devastated large areas. \"The earthquake has taken what were already marginal issues and has made them worse and made it more difficult to access information and even to access certain areas,\" McGown said. The initial quake has also been followed by numerous aftershocks of up to 6.4 magnitude. In Bangkok, which was also hit by the quake, rescue efforts have focused on a 30-story building that collapsed following the earthquake. With drones, sniffer dogs and heavy machinery, rescue operators have been working around the clock to free dozens of people thought to be trapped inside. Families of those trapped inside have congregated outside of the slumped building. Many have been waiting there for more than 24 hours, holding out hope that their loved ones will soon emerge.

    "full_content": "More than 12,000 acres have burned in North and South Carolina as wildfires continue to rage through the states’ western region. The situation has prompted emergency declarations in both states, and mandatory evacuations have been ordered in several counties.  The wildfires come as many continue to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene just six months ago. The category 4 storm killed more than 100 people in North Carolina and over 50 in South Carolina. This week’s blazes were in part fueled by downed timber from the hurricane, coupled with wind and dry conditions.  Advertisement Advertisement Here’s how you can help victims and first responders in the Carolinas.  Associa Cares was created to help families and communities in the wake of disasters. The organization aims to provide direct financial relief to those impacted and has already earmarked $100,000 to support individuals and families affected by the recent wildfires across North and South Carolina.  The American Red Cross has been providing emergency assistance and disaster relief for over a century. The organization has opened an evacuation shelter in South Carolina and is supporting several shelters in North Carolina. While it says it no longer is in need of supplies to help wildfire survivors, the organization is still accepting monetary donations. World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit food relief organization founded by celebrity chef José Andrés, is often on the ground providing meals for victims and first responders of disasters around the world. The organization is currently in North Carolina providing meals for first responders.  South Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an offshoot of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, is an association of groups that help provide services to communities affected by disaster. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division “ways to help” webpage directs individuals to make monetary donations to SCVOAD, and contact them for volunteer opportunities.  The city of Walhalla's fire department has posted a list of needed items for the 400 first responders combating fires in South Carolina. The department asks that the requested items, which range from eye drops to safety goggles, are delivered by Friday, March 28.",

Experts say the episode highlights the social media site's enduring influence, even as it helps amplify falsehoods. How did it happen? Around 8:30 a.m. ET, the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett was asked during a live Fox News interview whether President Trump would consider a 90-day pause to the sweeping tariffs he imposed on many countries last week. Hassett responded: \"I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.\" On X, that morphed into a bogus headline that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China. It appears the X account \"Hammer Capital\" was the first to share this false report, around 10:11 a.m. ET on Monday. The account has just over 1,100 followers, and it has a blue verification badge, a paid feature that helps enhance the reach of a user's posts. From there, the erroneous headline took on a life of its own. Dozens of other accounts with blue verification badges reshared it. Not long after, news organizations including Reuters and CNBC reported the unsubstantiated claim.  Around 10:12 a.m. ET, cheers broke out across the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, according to CNN, as the market rallied on the false premise that the White House was weighing a tariffs pause. About a minute later, it was posted by the X account \"Walter Bloomberg,\" which has more than 850,000 followers. Although the account is not affiliated with Bloomberg News, it often shares the news organization's headlines. The account's boosting of the false headline prompted chatter among CNBC analysts on live television about a possible 90-day reprieve from Trump's tariffs. Reuters, citing CNBC, then published a headline carrying the inaccurate tariff pause report. The White House denied the report. The Walter Bloomberg account deleted the post on X. Reuters and CNBC soon backtracked, but not before stock markets gyrated to the tune of $2.4 trillion between the time of 10:08 a.m. and 10:18 a.m., according to Dow Jones Market Data. In statements to NPR, Reuters said it has withdrawn the incorrect report, blaming a headline published on CNBC. When asked for comment, CNBC said it \"aired unconfirmed information in a banner,\" which it \"quickly\" corrected. The network would not comment on the source of its information. The wild market swing reflected how Wall Street investors are increasingly gripped with fear that Trump's tariffs could lead to global economic instability.  Neither X nor Musk responded to NPR's requests for comment. Reporters went back and forth with the relatively obscure finance-focused X account \"Hammer Capital\" that appears to have started the rumor. Whoever is behind the account claimed to be merely sharing information from \"trading desks,\" but would not elaborate. Attempts to reach the person behind the Hammer Capital account were unsuccessful. To scholars of disinformation like Kate Starbird at the University of Washington, the market mayhem spurred by posts on X underscores the dangers of social media with both few guardrails and policies in place that incentivize virality over truthfulness. \"Our social media systems — and X in particular — are designed in such a way that rumors spread extremely quickly, while corrections lag far behind. Verification is challenging (and slow), in part because it's often hard to determine the original source of a particular claim,\" Starbird told NPR.  \"Changes to account verification on X, which were put into place after Musk purchased Twitter, make it even more difficult now for social media users and other information consumers to figure out which accounts and what information we should trust.\"",

Lumiose City turns into a fight club at night. by  Charles Pulliam-Moore Real time day / night cycles have been featured in a lot of Pokémon titles since the Gold and Silver era, but Pokémon Legends: Z-A is going to take the classic mechanic in a wild new direction. During today’s March Direct presentation, Nintendo dropped a new Pokémon Legends: Z-A trailer showcasing a few of the game’s returning monsters and revealing more about how battling will work in this new take on Lumiose City.  Unlike the franchise’s previous games where you had to catch wild creatures out in, you know, the wild, Legends: Z-A will involve hunting down pokémon found throughout Lumiose itself as the city undergoes a massive redevelopment plan to make it more hospitable to both humans and pokémon.  The trailer makes it seem as if, in the daytime, Legends: Z-A’s gameplay will be more focused on catching pokémon, and NPC trainers you encounter won’t necessarily want to fight on sight. At night, however, the city’s “aura” changes and battle-hungry trainers flood its streets to participate in the Z-A Royale, which sounds like a competition to figure out who’s the best. Trainers participating in the Z-A Royale will be found in designated battle zones where making eye contact is all it takes to get things rolling. But, similar to the way you could get the jump on wild pokémon in Legends: Arceus, players will also be able to get the jump on Z-A Royale battlers by sneaking up behind them and sending out a pokémon to initiate a fight. Surprising NPCs will give you an advantage over them, but the trailer also makes it look like timing and dodging within the battle will be key to mastering Z-A. It’s also clear that participating in the Z-A Royale and going from Rank Z to Rank A will be necessary to complete the game’s story. But given how differently the game seems like it will play depending on the time of day, it feels like Nintendo wants this to be a Pokémon game you play how you want.

Per an update shared by the Myanmar authorities on Saturday, the death toll has risen above 1,600. In addition, authorities report over 3,000 people are injured, with over 100 others missing. Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, is among the hardest-hit areas, with widespread destruction. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a total of 18 people have been reported killed by the earthquake so far. 11 of those were at the site of the collapse of a high-rise building under construction. Dozens of people are said to be unaccounted for. Advertisement Advertisement On Sunday, March 30, a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck near Mandalay, prompting alarm before rescue efforts continued. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand Myanmar’s ruling military junta declared a state of emergency in several regions affected by the earthquake on Friday, and called for humanitarian aid in a rare show of international appeal. Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said in a statement that the earthquake “could not come at a worse time” for Myanmar, as it still reels from the 2021 military coup and subsequent displacement of masses in a civil war. “All parties to the armed conflict should be prioritizing the needs of civilians whose lives have been upended in this disaster and ensuring that they have unfettered access to aid,” Freeman said. “Human rights must be at the centre of all relief efforts, and there must be no discrimination in aid provision.” UNICEF, originally the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, has also addressed Myanmar’s precarious situation. A statement on the UNICEF USA website has called for “all parties to uphold the rights of children and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.” As the affected areas continue to recover—a process that has only just begun—countries around the globe have come out to send humanitarian aid. Here are the ways that you can help victims of the Myanmar earthquake. The United Nations is calling for donations in addition to an initial allocation of $5 million from the U.N. Emergency Fund by Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher. Donations will go directly to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund, and will “provide them with urgently needed food, water, shelter and other basic support at this critical time.” The “Red Cross Red Crescent is working to deliver emergency relief and to get help to those impacted by the earthquake as quickly as possible.” Teams from the Myanmar Red Cross Society are also working to connect hospitals and clinics with emergency blood donations. UNICEF runs disaster relief operations focused on children’s needs and has asked for donations specifically for children impacted and displaced by the earthquake. “UNICEF is on the ground in Myanmar, working with partners to meet children's needs. The earthquake is the latest blow to a country already struggling with escalating conflict and climate shocks,” the agency’s website reads. Save the Children is an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) that works specifically to protect children at risk. They have launched a “Children’s Emergency Fund” for youths in Myanmar in need of shelter and other basic needs in the aftermath of the disaster. Project HOPE is working to “address both urgent and long-term needs, including primary and mental health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene,” for those affected by the earthquake. The nonprofit organization has previously responded to other natural disasters by deploying humanitarian aid to places such as Morocco, Syria, Turkey, and Haiti.",

    "full_content": "A previously overlooked factor may have contributed to the debilitating strength of Hurricane Idalia, which cost the United States billions of dollars when it struck in August 2023. According to a team of researchers that studied the climatic conditions around the storm, the typical cocktail of weather conditions that feed a hurricane doesn’t add up in Idalia’s case. The team’s research analyzing the storm’s evolution was published last month in Environmental Research Letters. The team found that the usual suspectsâwarm sea surface temperatures, ocean heat beneath the surface, and low vertical wind shear all played a role in Idalia’s intensification. But the team found that a freshwater plumeâincluding river discharge into the Gulfâcreated a density gradient between the surface water and deeper, cooler water, allowing Idalia to continue to draw strength from the warmth of the Gulf’s surface. âWind wants to mix the water, bringing cold water up to the surface and warm water down to the depths,â said marine scientistÂ Chuanmin Hu, one of the studyâs authors, in a NASA Earth Observatory release. âBut the density gradient between surface fresh water and deeper salty water makes this difficult.â Plumes from rivers have historically contributed to the intensification of hurricanes; according to the release, more than two-thirds of storms between 1960 and 2000 that hit Category 5 strength at some point in their cycles passed over the historical region of freshwater plumes. âIf you have a persistent river plume in the right location at the right time,â Hu said, âyou may have a perfect storm.â Hurricane Idalia carved through Florida’s Big Bend before charting a northeasterly course across the American Southeast. The storm quickly swelled from a Category 1 to Category 4 storm, subsiding only slightly into a Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall on August 30, 2023, with maximum sustained winds of nearly 125 miles (205 kilometers) per hour. The hurricane raised concerns about gas contamination, cut off power for hundreds of thousands of people, and even dropped a tree on the Tallahassee home of Governor Ron DeSantis. The storm shaped up to be the costliest of 2023, tallying a whopping $3.6 billion in damages. The storm departed over the Atlantic on August 31 after cutting across Georgia and the South Carolina coast. The analysis of contextual factors in Idalia’s formation could help researchers better understand the conditions that foster extreme storms in the future. Consider Hurricane Milton, which shattered records in October 2024 when it intensified from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 storm in just 7 hours, after feeding on very warm waters in the western Gulf. Category 5 storms are the highest intensity on theÂ Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; to be a Category 5 storm, a system must achieve wind speeds greater than 157 miles per hour (253 kilometers per hour). When Milton touched down in central Florida as a Category 3 storm, it spawned at least three dozen tornadoes across the Sunshine State. As ocean temperatures continue to break records for warmth, we should expect more extreme and rapidly evolving hurricanes. Hopefully, similar research to the Idalia study will lead to improved forecast models,Â so that authorities can be prepared for these storms’ landfall.

    "full_content": "In his forty-plus years in the textile industry, Larry Severini has seen hundreds of factories close, as companies moved women’s wear and home furnishings and then other textile manufacturing overseas.  But Severeni was able to maintain two factories that make the blue backgrounds and white stars for American flags—until January 31, 2025. On that day, he closed his factory in Gaffney, S.C., for good, getting rid of millions of dollars of machinery and laying off dozens of workers, some of whom had been laboring there for decades.  Advertisement Advertisement “People are buying flags from China at an artificially low price that we can’t compete with,” says Severini, who still has one factory open, in Kingstree, S.C., which makes star fields for the flag and other textiles.  It may sound strange to hear of a manufacturing company closing right now. In the second Trump Administration, the President has promised—and levied—tariffs on countries including China, Canada, and Mexico in an effort to boost American manufacturing. Trump also levied tariffs on Chinese goods in his first term that the Biden Administration maintained. “This administration is leaving 40 years of failed industrial policy behind and bringing American manufacturing BACK!” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X  recently.  But despite the bravado, many of those working in the textile industry say conditions are tougher than ever, with 27 textile factories shuttering in the last 20 months, according to Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, a lobbying group.  They blame a once-obscure trade provision, called de minimis, which has been thrust into the spotlight in recent months. President Trump ended de minimis in a February executive order before reversing himself days later as chaos ensued. The White House said de minimis would resume when “adequate systems are in place” to deal with the shipments.  Created by Congress in 1938, de minimis allows people to import packages worth less than $800 without paying tariffs on those packages or going through formal customs paperwork. It was created as a nod to consumer fairness: travelers were able to bring back a certain amount of goods from overseas without paying customs on those goods, supporters reasoned, so people who couldn’t travel should have the same privilege. In 2016, Congress raised the threshold from $200 to $800. Retailers like Severini say that the de minimis provision allows Chinese factories to send cheap goods, such as American flags, to the U.S. without the same tariffs that they would have to pay to send the same product to China. Severini says he suspects that sellers on e-commerce websites like Amazon order large quantities of American flags, avoid paying tariffs on them through de minimis, and then sell them online, sometimes labeling them as made in the U.S.A.  “It’s a major hurdle that our industry really needs some breathing room from,” he says.  There are a huge number of goods that come into the country under de minimis. In 2023 alone, the U.S. saw $54.5 billion worth of de minimis imports, or about 1 billion total shipments, up from $0.05 billion, or 110 million shipments, in 2012. About 30% of de minimis shipments are goods that Americans buy on sites like Shein and Temu.  “It’s essentially a free trade agreement for China and the rest of the world,” says Glas, of NCTO.  Ironically, there’s evidence that Trump’s first-term trade war was what helped expand de minimis shipping. After the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, Chinese exporters looked for new ways to ship things to the U.S. and avoid tariffs, and landed on de minimis.  Whether ending de minimis could really jumpstart industries like textiles is up for debate. Most of the goods that people buy through de minimis are inexpensive, and so a 25% or even 40% tariff wouldn’t raise the cost of it very much. There are American flags listed on Temu, for example, for less than $3.  Avoiding de minimis saves importers money in other ways, says Amit Khandelwal, a Yale economics professor who recently co-authored a paper on what would happen if de minimis went away. Importers who don’t have the benefit of de minimis have to go through customs paperwork and logistics challenges that can increase the price of a package by as much as $20 apiece, which significantly raises costs.  Still, because of the cost of labor and materials overseas, Chinese and other manufacturers may still be able to make cheaper goods than those made in the U.S., Khandelwal says. “Domestic producers claim they will benefit from the end of de minimis,” he says. “I’m not so sure.”  In his research, Khandelwal also found that consumers who live in lower-income zip codes and those with higher shares of minorities disproportionately benefit from de minimis. They’re more likely to shop at sites like Temu and Shein and to buy goods that have come into the country under the provision. “If you remove de minimis, it’s going to look like a regressive tax,” says Khandelwal, meaning that it hurts lower-income people the most. Severini argues that these people are getting goods at an artificially low price. After all, countries like Mexico and China have much lower de minimis limits, he says. He hopes that Congress will get rid of the loophole entirely, which looks increasingly likely to some observers.  Doing so, Severini says, would help get his Kingstree factory back up to three shifts a day, which it was running before the pandemic—and before de minimis shipments started taking off. Workers in the factory make $16 an hour plus performance incentives, Severini says. One of his former workers laid off from the Gaffney did find a job, he adds—at an e-commerce warehouse helping sort goods that come in from overseas.",

    "full_content": "A major earthquake in Myanmar on Friday has caused more than 3,000 deaths and led to the collapse of numerous structures. Even though the south-east Asian nation is a high risk region for earthquakes, neighbouring Thailand and China - which were also affected by the quake - are not. The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it. Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away. The earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other. It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes. Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate. The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate. Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways.  There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long. Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other. This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault. As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake. Earthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface. The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey.  The size of the quake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell. \"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained.  \"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\" This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1,200km south towards Thailand. When it comes to why the earth shook so much, scientists believe it is because the quake was a rare \"super shear\" - meaning energy from the rupture in the earth's crust built up because it was moving faster than seismic waves can travel through the earth. Seismologist Prof Frederik Tilmann, from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Germany, explained in analysis shared online that the rupture travelled at a speed of about 5km per second - making it \"the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet\".  Because the fracture \"unzipped\" towards the south, it also directed this piled up energy towards the Thai capital, Bangkok, and this is why the earthquake had such an impact so far away.  How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil.  In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size.  So, Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense. While dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuchak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse. Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian Málaga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London. This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable. This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes. Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand. Prof Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant. Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied. Dr Pimarnmas said Bangkok's soft soil may have also played a part in its collapse, as it can amplify ground motions three or four times over. He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\" Having studied the video, Dr Málaga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas. \"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained.  \"Imagine a table supported only by legs, with no extra horizontal supports underneath. \"While this design has cost and architectural advantages, is performs poorly during earthquakes, often failing in a brittle and sudden (almost explosive) manner.\" Mandalay in Myanmar was much closer to where the ground slipped and would have experienced significantly more severe shaking than Bangkok. Although Myanmar regularly experiences earthquakes, Dr Ian Watkinson, a lecturer in earth sciences at Royal Holloway University, thought it was unlikely that many buildings were constructed to be earthquake-proof. \"General poverty, major political upheaval, alongside other disasters - e.g. the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 - has distracted the country from concentrating on the unpredictable risks from earthquakes,\" he said. \"This means that, in many cases, building design codes are not enforced, and construction happens in areas that could be prone to enhanced seismic risk, for example flood plains and steep slopes.\" Parts of Mandalay and its buildings also lie along the floodplain of the Ayerwaddy River. This makes them very vulnerable to a process called liquefaction. This happens when the soil has a high water content, and the shaking causes the sediment to lose its strength and behave like a liquid. This increases the risk of landslides and building collapses, as the ground can no longer hold them up. Dr So warned that there was \"always a chance\" of further damage to buildings near a fault line due to aftershocks - tremors that follow an earthquake, which can be caused by the sudden transfer of energy into nearby rock. \"Most of the time aftershocks are smaller than the main shock, and tend to decrease in size and frequency over time,\" she said.",

    "full_content": "Business owners on River Road are expressing concerns as a multi-phase construction project by the Louisville Water Company threatens to further complicate an already economically-challenging year. The project, which will replace a decades-old water line with two new ones, will impact several establishments along the heavily-used thoroughfare for the next two years. Restaurants and other businesses along the road say they're already seeing fewer patrons, making things harder when some are still struggling to recover from damage left behind by severe flooding in mid-February. KingFish manager Chris Sparrow said construction is already impacting the establishment with only a handful of tables and frequent calls from area residents asking if the business is open. With clean-up still ongoing from the flooding, he worries the project will prevent him from getting back on even footing. \"It's definitely taking a toll on us already,\" Sparrow said. \"The river was not very kind to us. We're going to have to spend money to get that mess cleaned up from the flood, and that money's not going to be generated back to us from the business that we're not going to be getting because of the construction.\" Construction will impact River Road, frequently used by commuters to get to and from downtown, and is expected to back up traffic on Interstate 71 and U.S. 42, said John Varanese, owner of River House Restaurant and Raw Bar. The best detour to access open businesses near the construction is Mellwood Avenue to Mockingbird Valley Road, which some could consider too far to travel. \"We've already had a challenging year. In the summertime, we could look at a thousand customers a day,\" he said. \"Now is the time to visit because it's not just the business, it's the livelihood of 120 employees just at this one location, let alone the other businesses on River Road that are going to be affected by this.\" Related: River Road closes Monday as Louisville Water Company starts project construction Sparrow says heading into the peak season for KingFish, he's hopeful for the best but worried that fewer guests will frequent the establishment. After Memorial Day, the restaurant typically hosts a motorcycle bike night on a weekly basis, often drawing in a large turnout with half the parking lot designated for bikes, but Sparrow says some won't want to drive through \"a bunch of construction.\" Louisville Water Company spokesperson Kathleen Speicher said the organization began working with area businesses prior to construction and is \"maintaining a consistent flow of communication with them\" throughout the process. \"We have posted numerous signs letting drivers know how to access the restaurants and businesses located in the area. We hope to minimize the traffic impact as much as possible, and we encourage customers to continue visiting those restaurants and businesses,\" Speicher said. \"Louisville Water realizes two years of rolling road closures is daunting, and we are working with our contractor to expedite that timeline if we can do so safely and efficiently.\" Reach Marina Johnson at Marina.Johnson@courier-journal.com.",

LONDON -- An earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude has rocked Southeast Asia on Friday, according to the United States Geological Survey. USGS is reporting the epicenter of the quake was in Mandalay, Myanmar, but at least three people were killed and 68 others were injured when a building that was under construction collapsed in Bangkok as the earthquake struck the region on Friday, according to Thailand’s National Institute of Emergency Medicine (NIEM), which said there was an unknown number of people still trapped in the rubble. The extent of the damage in Mandalay -- the second largest city in Myanmar -- is largely unknown this morning due to it being under very tight state control. However, it is thought that the damage could be extensive since this earthquake is stronger than many other historic quakes -- including the Northridge earthquake that affected the Los Angeles area of California on Jan. 17, 1994, which is remembered as one of the most destructive and deadly in California history. Bangkok is approximately 600 miles away from Mandalay and suffered notable damage as well as collapsed buildings. NIEM said there were approximately 320 construction workers on site when the building in Bangkok collapsed at 70 people are currently missing, according to a statement published on social media. Approximately 20 workers are still trapped in the elevator shaft with the number of deaths expected to climb, NIEM continued. Alarms reportedly went off in buildings across the Thai capital city when the earthquake hit around 1:30 p.m., according to the Associated Press. \"We were under the main Sukhumvit railway station and we thought a train had crashed on the initial tremor,\" a British citizen who is in the Thai capital on a business trip and wished to remain anonymous told ABC News. \"But then as it continued, people started to run outside and the hotels were evacuated to the streets.\" The Royal Thai Police said they are helping to evacuate people from buildings across the city into safe areas, according to a statement published on social media. A video obtained by ABC News from a WeWork office in Bangkok shows water pouring from a rooftop swimming pool as people ran across the office towards the exits. Two of Bangkok’s main public transportation systems, the BTS -- an elevated train line -- and the MRT, which is mostly underground, have stopped service as authorities respond to the earthquake aftermath, Thai police said. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s ruling junta has declared a state of emergency in six regions -- Sagaing, Mandalay, Magway, northeastern Shan State, Nay Pyi Taw and Bago – after the earthquake struck the country, followed by a series of aftershocks. Myanmar is mired in yearslong civil war, and Mandalay is one of the major cities that the junta still controls. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

    "full_content": "Lots of interesting details in the story: The US Department of Justice on Wednesday announced the indictment of 12 Chinese individuals accused of more than a decade of hacker intrusions around the world, including eight staffers for the contractor i-Soon, two officials at China’s Ministry of Public Security who allegedly worked with them, and two other alleged hackers who are said to be part of the Chinese hacker group APT27, or Silk Typhoon, which prosecutors say was involved in the US Treasury breach late last year. […] According to prosecutors, the group as a whole has targeted US state and federal agencies, foreign ministries of countries across Asia, Chinese dissidents, US-based media outlets that have criticized the Chinese government, and most recently the US Treasury, which was breached between September and December of last year. An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg News found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stole more than 3,000 files in that intrusion. The indictments highlight how, in some cases, the hackers operated with a surprising degree of autonomy, even choosing targets on their own before selling stolen information to Chinese government clients. The indictment against Yin Kecheng, who was previously sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January for his involvement in the Treasury breach, quotes from his communications with a colleague in which he notes his personal preference for hacking American targets and how he’s seeking to ‘break into a big target,’ which he hoped would allow him to make enough money to buy a car. \nTags: China, cyberattack, cyberespionage, espionage, hacking, law enforcement  \nPosted on March 11, 2025 at 1:14 PM\t\t\t•\n\t\t\t17 Comments",

Will this enlightened approach prevail? By Erica Gies edited by Mark Fischetti Floodwater inundates Pájaro, Calif., on March 12, 2023, after the Pájaro River, swollen with rain from an atmospheric river storm, breached local levels. Shae Hammond/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images Controlling nature by bulldozing dirt and pouring concrete has long been the guiding vision of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. For 250 years that ethos inspired both awe and disgust. “In my science training, the Army Corps destroyed everything. They’re the enemy,” says geomorphologist Julie Beagle, who spent much of her early career working to repair ecosystems damaged by “gray” infrastructure such as dams and levees built by the Corps. “My first boss had a sign on her desk that said, ‘Kill the Corps.’” To such critics, damaging nature was the Corps’s core competence. So plenty of people were skeptical in 2010 when the Corps rolled out an Engineering with Nature (EWN) initiative, saying it now aspired to work with nature rather than dominate it—a dramatic change in culture and practice. Engineers and scientists are moving constrictive levees farther from riverbanks and reconnecting rivers with floodplains. They are reusing sediment dredged from shipping channels to strengthen disintegrating tidal marshes. They are partially acquiescing to rivers’ chosen paths while retaining navigation channels. The initiative is relatively small; there are seven EWN programs sprinkled across the Corps’s 43 districts (five of which are international). But the changes convinced Beagle four years ago to leave her job at the San Francisco Estuary Institute and become chief of environmental planning for the Corps’s San Francisco district. She is now one of four “practice leads” who demonstrate and teach EWN across the Corps’s 37,000 employees. One example of her pioneering work is a big project in central California’s Pájaro River basin designed to protect communities from flooding while recharging groundwater to aid farmers and restoring habitat for threatened fish.

Beagle’s career move was risky, given the Corps’s inertia. Its long insistence that it could and should reshape nature for economic benefit has dominated U.S. civil works culture and has been exported globally through Corps projects in more than 130 countries, a practice some call “hydrocolonialism.” Beagle says many people from her adviser’s generation “really rolled over” when she and several other mid-career scientists she knew went to the Corps. But she saw the move as an opportunity to be “a cultural changemaker” in an agency that has remade vast landscapes and waterways. With a $7.2-billion budget for civil works in fiscal year 2025, the agency’s employees oversee 24,000 miles of levees; 926 harbors that they keep dredged for shipping; 749 dams; 350 miles of beaches and dunes; numerous navigation channels and locks; and seawalls and bulkheads along hundreds of miles of coast. How the Corps thinks and what it does shape our world. Levees are built to control nature, but nature often wins, as it did during the Pájaro River flood. DRONE BASE/Reuters/Redux The consequences of its decisions can be deadly. The most horrific failure in recent memory occurred during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 1,400 people in New Orleans and the Gulf region died when levees and floodwalls gave way; 80 percent of New Orleans lay underwater, some areas for 43 days. The Gulf’s famous marshes help to protect human communities from storm surges, but more than a century of levees and dams on the Mississippi River had deprived the marshes of 70 percent of the sediment they need to stand up to a relentless sea. More than 2,000 square miles have eroded away since the 1930s. Shipping canals have sliced and diced freshwater marshes, providing pathways for salt water to infiltrate and kill vegetation and for storm surges to rear up and overtake near-shore communities. Katrina bowled straight up a wide navigation channel called the Mississippi River–Gulf Outlet that the Corps had cut through protective marshes. The Corps’s subsequent shift toward nature-based solutions—working with or mimicking natural systems—is part of an increasingly mainstream global movement. The 160,000-member American Society of Civil Engineers issued a policy statement last summer supporting the practice. People are increasingly recognizing the need for nature-based solutions as climate change is making floods and droughts more severe, and changes in land use—urban sprawl, industrial agriculture and forestry, levees and dams—have dramatically altered the water cycle and eroded healthy ecosystems that for centuries acted as buffers to destruction. Nature-based solutions mean restoring the health of degraded ecosystems so they can provide clean water, absorb floods, store carbon, grow food and support life. Eileen Shader, senior director of floodplain restoration at American Rivers, a nonprofit that advocates for healthy waterways, says that in some cases, “you’re solving the problem by unbuilding.” Still, the Corps’s concept of nature-based solutions tilts more toward engineering and concrete. As Jeff King, national lead of the EWN program, puts it, projects fall somewhere on “a continuum of green-gray.” “You could call the 20th century the century of reinforced concrete. My hope is the 21st century is the century of nature.” —Todd Bridges, University of Georgia The approach could rapidly become more widespread thanks to a Corps rule that went into effect in January 2025 that requires the agency to consider nature-based options on par with gray infrastructure options whenever feasible. The rule also expands the traditional cost-benefit analysis to factor in environmental and social gains of projects, even if it’s impossible to assign a dollar figure. It is “the most significant policy-change update for the Corps in a generation, without a doubt,” says biologist Todd Bridges, who in 2010 created the EWN program out of the Corps’s research division, where he worked for 30 years. Within weeks after President Donald Trump took office this year, his new administration began purging federal government websites of language that seemed progressive, freezing funds for scientific research, and dismantling departments that support human rights, science and the environment. It’s reasonable to ask whether EWN—a progressive shift in a conservative agency—would be a target. The Project 2025 manifesto guiding many administration actions mentions the Corps only once, in passing, but that doesn’t mean the agency will go untouched. At the end of January, in an unusual act, Trump ordered the Corps to release water from two federal reservoirs in California, with a stated goal of letting it flow about 200 miles south to help fire-ravaged Los Angeles. The Corps released 2.2 billion gallons, but the water did not come close to reaching the city. Local water managers scrambled to prevent flooding of nearby towns, while farmers were dismayed to see water they will need in the summer flushed away. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the engineering wing of the U.S. Army. Despite its military basis, its workforce today is 98 percent civilian. Its civil works division is tasked with navigation, reduction of flood and storm damage, and environmental restoration. Local groups lobby Congress for work in their areas, and Congress authorizes projects and partial funding. Congressional authorizations have historically proscribed a single objective, such as flood-risk reduction, a narrow focus at odds with the systems-oriented thinking required for nature-based solutions. The Corps’s urge to try to control nature was solidified in the mid-19th century, when dueling congressional reports outlined how to reduce Mississippi River flooding and ensure navigation. One advocated for a hybrid engineering-nature approach—using not only levees but also outlets to release high river flows, as well as wetlands to absorb rain. It lost out to another vision authored by a Corps engineer who argued for a levees-only approach. The belief that strong walls can best protect communities has dominated the engineering psyche ever since. But the unintended consequences can be extreme. Florida’s Kissimmee River was an early, expensive lesson. In response to prolonged flooding in 1947, the Corps wanted to rush away high river water instead of letting the river overflow onto its floodplains and wetlands. To create a straighter channel with faster water flow, it spent nine years, from 1962 to 1971, cutting out the river’s natural meanders that slow water, shortening the waterway from 103 miles to just 56. The work dried out thousands of acres of wetlands and floodplains, harmed wildlife and increased the flow of pollution into Lake Okeechobee. Damage was immediate and so extensive that Congress authorized the Corps to put back the curves. “A hallmark of 20th-century engineering is that people simplified the natural in order to get what we want,” says Bridges, now a professor of practice in resilient and sustainable systems at the University of Georgia’s College of Engineering. Then he corrects himself: “What we think we want.” Ripley Cleghorn; Sources: National Inventory of Dams; National Levee Database; USACE's Dredging Information System (data) Simplifying the natural order can even worsen the problem engineers are trying to solve. Today 3,500 miles of levees line the Mississippi River. Each levee constricts space for water, raising the surface level higher, speeding up its flow, and worsening flooding for communities that lack a levee or are near one that breaks. Yet the Corps evaluates each new levee on its own immediate merits, not in conjunction with those on the rest of the river. As geomorphologist Nicholas Pinter of the University of California, Davis, has written, even the Corps has acknowledged that the result is “‘death by a thousand blows,’ through the incremental loss of floodplain land to development.” Another unintended consequence is that levees encourage people to move into harm’s way. The Great Flood of 1993 left areas around the Missouri and upper Mississippi Rivers above flood stage for up to 195 days. The Corps worked with a St. Louis levee district to build a 500-year levee—an awkward term meaning the levee would limit the risk of flood in any given year to 0.2 percent (statistically, there is a one-in-500 chance of a flood happening any year). The levee made people feel safe enough to build, in the first decade alone, 28,000 new homes and more than 13 square miles of commercial and industrial development and roadways on land that had been underwater. But it’s a false sense of security, revealed by a dark industry joke that there are two kinds of levees: ones that have failed and ones that will fail. “People think, ‘Why do I flood?’” says Jo-Ellen Darcy, board chair of American Rivers. “Well, you’re living in a floodplain. They’re not named that for no reason.” Indeed, floodplains are a classic nature-based solution. Their job, Darcy says, is “to absorb floods, and they can’t do that if people are living there with concrete structures and malls.” Katrina was a turning point in the Corps’s approach, says Jane Smith, who was a senior research scientist there for 42 years and is now a professor of coastal hydrodynamics at the University of Florida. When Smith and her colleagues ran models after the storm, she says, “we started to see how incredibly important the wetlands were in terms of protection from hurricane storm surge and waves.” Before that, “we didn’t really think of the natural features that provide protection as being part of our projects,” she adds. But Bridges recalls that many Corps employees outside the research division weren’t ready to hear it. He says an engineer told him, “We don’t need any of that tree-hugger science.” Before joining American Rivers, Darcy led the Corps’s civil works as an assistant secretary of the U.S. Army from 2009 to 2017. During her tenure she emphasized an important tweak in language used by the Corps. “It wasn’t ‘flood control,’” she explains. “Nobody can control a flood.” She used “flood-risk reduction,” which acknowledges that reality—and sends a message within the Corps and to the public about the limits of what’s possible. Shader, at American Rivers, works with the Corps nationally and says the agency’s current openness to what she considers effective nature-based solutions varies geographically. “San Francisco is absolutely the lead,” she says. “They have a dedicated staff that is working to create interdisciplinary teams and integrate these concepts into every project.” That’s partly thanks to Beagle, who showed people across the Corps how to take a big standard project and insert nature-based solutions. In March 2023 an atmospheric river storm struck central California, bursting three levees on the Pájaro River and flooding the eponymous town, which is populated by farmworkers and surrounded by fields of berries and greens. The disaster wasn’t a surprise; the four- to 12-foot-high levees lining the river and its two tributaries, Corralitos Creek and Salsipuedes Creek, dated to 1949 and promised just eight-year flood protection—which equates to a 12.5 percent chance of flooding in any year. In 1966 Congress authorized the Corps to build taller, wider levees, but partly because the economics of protecting the low-income community didn’t seem to work out, the project never moved forward. The Corps later realized that adequate protection required giving the waterways more room. It wanted to move some of the long earthen levees that run for 13 miles along both sides of the waterways farther back from the banks. These “setback levees” would create extra space between the levees to hold more water during high flows, reducing overflow flooding. Julie Beagle is leading an innovative Army Corps project that shows how to work with nature. Erica Gies That solution required local people to give up some of their land, and residents resisted for decades. But as the toll of repeated floods mounted, they finally gave in, says Mark Strudley, executive director of the Pájaro Regional Flood Management Agency, a local partner to the Corps. Strudley says farmers in the area realized they were having a hard time cultivating that soggy land, anyway. In October 2024 the Corps broke ground on the multiyear project, known internally as “100 for 100.” It bought up to 100 feet of landowners’ properties along the waterways, offering in return 100-year flood protection: a 1 percent chance of flooding in any year. But Beagle saw that this standard project could be tweaked to simultaneously solve another local problem: a declining groundwater table caused by farmers’ overpumping. When a wild river runs high, water overflows the banks, spreads across the floodplain and slows. It has time to sink underground to supply aquifers, deposit soil nutrients and fine dirt that continually reshape the river, and create habitat that supports fish. But in the decades that the river and its tributaries had been cut off from their floodplains, water squeezing through the levee-narrowed river channel had run faster. Speed gave it power to cut down into the earth, leaving the creeks about 10 to 25 feet lower than the surrounding farmland. If the Corps just set the levees back, Beagle knew, the river would reach the riverbanks only when it ran really, really high. Most of the time water would still be stuck down in the channel, speeding away. It wouldn’t have a chance to replenish groundwater, redistribute soil or help fish. Beagle and Strudley convinced the Corps to turn the plan into an EWN project by pointing out that the change would in fact save money. To build the new, wider levees, the Corps would have had to truck in dirt, which is expensive. Instead it will excavate much of the dirt from the former farmland that will now be inside the setback levees. It will also dig in a way to re-create some of the river’s natural functions, fashioning side channels and earthen steps from the new levees down to the creek. When the river runs high, the channels and steps will slow water, giving it time to sink underground inside the setback levees. This action will refill dwindling groundwater reservoirs and increase flood protection by ensuring some water gets absorbed by the ground and moving the rest of it downstream over a longer period. The design will also allow sediment swishing around within the wider riverbed to create an accessible floodplain again. The river will reshape what the engineers build, and that’s okay, Strudley says. “‘Correcting’ is fighting physics,” he says, “which in general doesn’t end well and wastes a lot of money.” The higher water table will allow farmers to pump water more easily and will feed the creek in the dry season. Slow water inside the levees will allow algae and plankton to grow, feeding fish such as the South-Central California Coast steelhead, a threatened species, and providing refuges where they can rest during their mating migration upstream. The more natural waterway will attract other wildlife, perhaps creating recreation spots for residents and even attracting ecotourists. Although multiple benefits are beyond the singularly focused congressional authorizations, local and state partners want them. Strudley worked with California’s Department of Water Resources, which ponied up the local funding because it is motivated to reverse dropping water tables. “Recognition of those benefits is why the state invested,” Strudley says. “Multibenefit is how you get things done these days. The Army Corps is catching up to that.” Reconfiguring levees along the Pájaro River and its tributaries to slow down rushing storm water will protect people nearby, resupply underground aquifers and restore fish habitat. Erica Gies Scientists from universities in the area are studying those benefits, measuring how 100 for 100 will affect groundwater recharge, sediment movement and fish populations. Quantifying the benefits is fundamental, says King, the national head of EWN, “because engineers have to feel comfortable understanding how these things are going to perform.” Many of these concepts are commonplace in restoration circles, Beagle says, but not so familiar to engineers. “Reading the landscape and understanding how nature works is a different set of skills,” she says. The Corps has a manual for how to build a levee, but it does not have one for floodplain reconnection. It will soon, though. Beagle has co-written national guidelines for floodplain reconnection in the same format as Corps instructions for building a levee, with “equations, loadings, shear stresses, things like that,” she says. Part of Beagle’s role is to educate Corps employees from other districts as they do rotations in the San Francisco district. “It’s really, really satisfying to watch these ideas take off,” she says. She still encounters resistance, however. Some colleagues complain that nature-based solutions are a headache and more expensive because they think these approaches mean adding bells and whistles to an existing project. Yet engineering with nature is often less expensive, Beagle says: “A healthier system maintains itself to a larger degree.” Each of the Corps’s six other EWN proving grounds has its own Pájaros—projects that showcase new approaches. Monica Chasten, head of EWN in the Philadelphia district, is shoring up disintegrating marshes near the southern tip of New Jersey in a 24-square-mile area known as the Seven Mile Island Innovation Lab. Her specialty, coastal engineering, is fundamentally different from civil engineering. “It’s not like designing a bridge,” she says. “Not everything is exact. It’s almost like an art.” Hurricane Sandy was a revelation in the region because marshes and dunes did an especially good job of protecting people. Softer than seawalls, they absorb wave energy rather than bouncing it onto neighboring stretches of coast. But sea-level rise and sediment scarcity threaten to destroy half of the region’s marshes by 2100. The scarcity is partly the result of a long-standing Corps practice. When it dredged fine sediment to maintain coastal shipping channels, it dumped the material into inland basins to simplify compliance with regulations aimed at protecting coastal areas from possible pollutants in the sediment. But in 2023 chief of engineers Lt. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon (now retired) realized the Corps was throwing away valuable material and set a goal that by 2030 it would reuse 70 percent of everything it dredged. Chasten says her district is on track to go beyond that. Some of the fine-grained sediment the Corps dredges from the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway floats in from the marshes to begin with, so Chasten’s team is pumping clean sediment back into the needy marshes. The impact will be transformative, predicts Lenore Tedesco, executive director of the Wetlands Institute, a New Jersey organization that works on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and is a partner to the Corps. “We’ve built 30 to 50 years of resilience into that marsh,” she says. Engineering with nature can save money because a functional ecosystem is likely to require less maintenance than fully engineered infrastructure. Erica Gies A thousand miles away the Corps’s St. Louis district is following nature’s lead to unravel a problem that the agency helped to create there: floodplain occupation. Edward Brauer, a hydraulic engineer and an EWN project lead, has been relinquishing part of a floodplain to the Mississippi River in Dogtooth Bend, a 17,000-acre chunk of Illinois inside a U-shaped turn of the river that borders Missouri. In the 19th century the area was a rich, shifting blend of wetlands, floodplain lakes, bottomland hardwood forest, cypress and tupelo slough, and cane thickets. “The river did what rivers do and meandered across the landscape,” Brauer says. Levees the Corps installed to create farmland were essentially seeking to stop time. But “it’s a constant battle with the river,” EWN founder Bridges says. And the river is on a roll. The area has flooded increasingly often—in 1993, 2011, 2016, 2017 and 2019—repeatedly washing out roads, ruining crops, and flooding homes in Olive Branch and Miller City. During major breaches, one third of the Mississippi’s flow gushes overland, taking a shortcut across the U. In 2019 Dogtooth Bend was inundated for nearly nine months. Letting the river make the cut might be the most nature-based solution. But the Corps also has a mandate to maintain shipping channels. Brauer is trying to negotiate a truce. Residents tired of repeated flooding have accepted buyouts. On those newly available lands, Brauer’s district is restoring natural floodplains and bottomland forests—habitat for at-risk species that also accommodates the river, reducing the frequency and force of its thrusts across the bend. The vegetation slows water and catches sediment that might otherwise move downstream, reinforcing the existing channel instead. Projects such as Pájaro, Seven Mile and Dogtooth Bend may become more common thanks to key points in the new rule: requirements for equal consideration of nature-based solutions, as well as a broader cost-benefit analysis. The rule, called for in congressional legislation dating back to 2007, was drafted in 2013, but passage was stymied for years by congresspeople who didn’t want the Corps to stop weighting economics over all other things. That dynamic shifted in 2021 when R. D. James, appointed by Trump as the assistant secretary for civil works, became concerned that low-income communities suffering from the massive 2019 Mississippi River floods were being bypassed by the standard cost-benefit analysis. So he wrote a memo outlining the inclusion of social and environmental factors. Still, the new rule does not correct a fatal flaw in standard cost-benefit analyses. A gray project’s destruction of natural systems’ services—absorbing floods, cleaning pollution, providing water in the dry season, generating food, storing carbon dioxide—is not counted against its benefits. Nor does the Corps deduct for a project’s likelihood of increasing flood risk in neighboring communities that are not protected. American Rivers provided input for the rule, and Shader says she’s glad it finally passed. But she’s concerned that it doesn’t provide criteria for choosing between nature-based solutions and gray projects, such as accurately tallying the potential losses. “So it really depends on that individual district and the nonfederal sponsors’ interests,” she says. Trump is likely to choose a new assistant secretary for civil works in his current presidential term. Michael L. Connor, who held that position until October 2024, said then that he’s hopeful the rule will not be overturned. “I don’t think this is a politically controversial rule,” he says. “We were directed to carry this out by the Water Resources Development Act in 2020 that was enacted during President Trump’s term and by a split Congress,” he said. “[It’s] an initiative that has broad support across the spectrum.” Although the new administration was disrupting government in its early days, Darcy says examples of local partners gaining multiple benefits may be politically powerful enough to convince the president and Congress to leave the new rule alone. Perhaps it is dawning on people throughout Congress and the Corps that “the control of nature”—the title of writer John McPhee’s 1989 book about the Corps—is futile. McPhee wrote then that “the Corps has been conceded the almighty role of God.” Subsequent decades have been a reckoning with the almighty power of nature. Regardless of the rule’s fate, the Corps is part of an ongoing, global shift toward nature-based solutions as people recognize the design savvy of harnessing that power. “The 20th century, you could call it the century of reinforced concrete,” Bridges says. “My hope is the 21st century is the century of nature.”",

    "full_content": "Dry conditions, wind and trees downed by Hurricane Helene fueled wildfires in North Carolina and South Carolina, where evacuation orders were in effect Tuesday. Many people in the area are still getting over the hurricane that hit in September, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Bo Dossett. “A lot of the damage and the blowdown, the downed trees from Hurricane Helene are contributing to the difficulties that our firefighters are facing trying to contain this fire and so that has just been kind of one ongoing crisis from September all through into the spring for a lot of these residents,” Dossett said. “This is one more thing that they’re having to deal with on top of what they experienced back in the fall.” Advertisement Advertisement The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for parts of the South Carolina Upstate, western North Carolina and northeast Georgia through Tuesday night, as conditions were expected to be favorable for the rapid spread of wildfire with lingering dry air and winds picking up to 10 to 20 mph (16 to 32 kph) and gusting 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph). Mandatory evacuations were in effect for 146 properties in rural Polk County on Tuesday, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte, North Carolina, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon. Three fires there have burned at least 9.6 square miles (25 square kilometers) in that county and in neighboring Henderson County as of Tuesday, and the two larger fires are uncontained, according to the forest service. Officials released maps Tuesday that show evacuation zones in the two counties. The Black Cove Fire is one of the larger blazes. Officials said a downed power line sparked that fire, but the causes of the other two fires are under investigation. Henderson County has issued voluntary evacuation orders and opened an emergency shelter. Volunteer fire departments were on standby, Henderson County spokesperson Mike Morgan told WLOS-TV. “Especially near some of the homes where if the fire did jump, we can be there to help protect those homes,” Morgan said. “We’re here to monitor the situation very closely.” Two fires were burning in the mountains of South Carolina. The fires in Table Rock State Park and nearby Persimmon Ridge have burned a combined 2.3 square miles (5.9 square kilometers), the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. Officials said both fires were ignited by human activity and neither were contained as of Monday night. No injuries were reported, and no structures were imminently threatened as of Monday night, but voluntary evacuations were issued for about 100 homes over the weekend. On Tuesday morning, the forestry commission updated an earlier announcement to say no evacuations were planned near the Persimmon Ridge Fire, but residents were urged to be prepared to leave their homes if an evacuation is suggested in the future. “The weather over the next few days remains concerning, as relative humidities are expected to remain very low, and the forecasted wind speeds will still be conducive to spreading the fire,” the forestry commission said. Dry weather and millions of trees knocked down by Hurricane Helene last year are creating a long and active fire season in the Carolinas, according to North Carolina State University forestry and environmental resources professor Robert Scheller. Scheller predicted this busy fire season if the region saw dry weather after the hurricane. “Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,” Scheller said. “Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.” Despite recent rain, most of the Carolinas are abnormally dry or experiencing a moderate drought, according to federal monitors.",

The death toll from the powerful quake that hit on March 28 rose to 3,471, state media reported, with 4,671 people injured and another 214 still missing. Myanmar's military has struggled to run the country since overthrowing the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, leaving the economy and basic services, including healthcare, in tatters, a situation exacerbated by the quake.",

LONDON -- The death toll from last week's 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar rose to 3,085 people as of Thursday morning, according to an update released by the country's military government. Another 4,715 people have been injured and 341 others remain missing, the junta said. The epicenter of Friday's magnitude earthquake was near the northern city of Mandalay -- Myanmar's second-largest city. But severe damage has been reported across the country, with thousands of buildings razed, roads destroyed and bridges collapsed. The earthquake also rocked Thailand, where at least 22 people have been confirmed killed and 35 others injured in the capital Bangkok, according to the city's Metropolitan Administration. Most of the casualties there were related to the collapse of a high-rise building that was under construction when the powerful quake struck the region. Search and rescue teams have been working around the clock to find the 72 people who were reported as missing from the incident, Bangkok officials said, with hopes that some may still be alive beneath the heavy, thick layers of debris seven days later. City officials expressed concern that it could rain Thursday, which might hinder ongoing search and rescue efforts. \"We hope that a miracle will happen,\" the administration said in a situation update posted to Facebook. \"For those trapped beneath the debris, if they are still alive, the heat may not be a big issue because there are vents and it is not as hot as above,\" it said. \"The main problem is dehydration.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

For months, Trump has said he's considering getting rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the country's disaster response arm. \"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government,\" Trump said while visiting the Los Angeles fires in January. \"FEMA is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation.\" But emergency management experts say Trump's order technically wouldn't do much to shift responsibility. Currently, local and state governments are already in charge of disasters. The question is whether the Trump administration will begin withdrawing the federal resources and funding that states rely on. When a major hurricane, flood or wildfire hits, FEMA starts working on a disaster only when requested by the state government. The agency organizes thousands of federal workers who help in disaster response and process claims for millions of dollars in aid. Even then, states and local governments still remain in charge. Have information you want to share about ongoing changes at FEMA or elsewhere in the federal government? Reach out to this reporter through encrypted communications on Signal at sommer.55 Without FEMA, states would need to find thousands of additional personnel to inspect damage, distribute disaster aid and plan the rebuilding of public infrastructure. Without federal funding, states would face billions of dollars in recovery costs. After Hurricane Irma in 2017, Florida relied on more than $5.5 billion dollars from the federal government. FEMA also helps states prepare for disasters, which can reduce the damage they cause and the number of lives that are lost. One study from the National Institute of Building Sciences, a non-profit research group, found that federal investment of $27 billion since 1995 to prepare infrastructure for flooding will ultimately save $160 billion. Many state emergency management offices also rely on federal grants to pay their employees. While many states advocate for simplifying FEMA's process for distributing disaster aid, they say FEMA is still a vital partner. As the climate gets hotter, hurricanes, floods and wildfires are getting more intense. FEMA is now responding to three to four times more disasters now than it did in the 1980s. \"It seems counterintuitive to discuss, in a time when we have more and more severe events, when states need more and more help, that we would provide less and less federal resources to support those states,\" says Tim Manning, a former deputy administrator at FEMA under the Obama administration. As soon as Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina in 2024, emergency managers knew they had a monumental task ahead. The storm left a broad swath of destruction in its wake. Heavy rainfall, exceeding 30 inches in some spots, washed out roads and flooded homes and buildings across many towns, some becoming almost impossible to reach. When disasters are larger than both local and state governments are able to handle, they can call in federal help by requesting a federal disaster declaration. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper made that request the day the storm hit, setting the stage for federal resources to come in, like FEMA. Still, FEMA doesn't take over the disaster responses. \"The locals are in charge of their county and their situation and the state of North Carolina advises FEMA on what we need,\" says Justin Graney, chief of external affairs for North Carolina Emergency Management. FEMA is also responsible for marshalling resources from the entire federal government, including from the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \"FEMA doesn't have any helicopters,\" Manning says. \"It doesn't have any aircraft, doesn't have any ships. FEMA's role is to coordinate all those resources from the federal government in support of the states. They are just the organizers.\" As North Carolina residents began taking in the damage from the storm, the immediate needs were for shelter, hot food and medical help, as well as search and rescue for missing people. \"Pretty much everything we had to throw at the storm, we threw at the storm,\" Graney says. \"And then 39 other states sent us resources and teams. So it was a massive response to what turned out to be a massive, catastrophic storm.\" That response included 8,500 federal workers for both Hurricanes Helene and Milton, a storm that hit Florida two weeks later. FEMA brought in its own staff from all over the country, but had to call in personnel from other federal agencies to fill the need. \n                During major disasters, FEMA sends thousands of staff, as well as organizing personnel from throughout the federal government, to help with disaster aid and search and rescue.\n                \n                    \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n One of FEMA's primary roles is getting aid to disaster victims, what's known as \"individual assistance.\" That includes funds for finding temporary housing and funding repairs on homes, when it's not covered by the owner's insurance policy. Some assistance is designed to reach disaster victims within days, allowing them to replace food, pay for temporary hotel stays and replace vital items like medications and clothing. To process those claims, FEMA's call centers for Hurricane Helene got more than half a million calls per week, a volume so high that many went unanswered. Without FEMA, states would need to find and train a similar staffing effort, able to process disaster aid in a very short time. Many states share resources, sending teams to other states in times of need. But as disasters get more intense and frequent with climate change, states have fewer resources to share. \"Those resources become taxed,\" says Claire Connolly Knox, a professor of emergency and crisis management at the University of Central Florida. \"That's where having a federal entity come in and be able to assist and backfill those resources, whether that's people, goods, services, is important.\" FEMA also gives funding to local governments and tribes to rebuild public infrastructure after disasters, including schools, roads, bridges and parks, known as \"public assistance.\" Ahead of disasters, FEMA offers grants so communities can make their infrastructure less likely to be destroyed. Trump has ordered the creation of a new council to do a \"full-scale review\" of FEMA, including recommendations for how to reform the agency. Their report is due within six months of their first meeting, which has yet to take place. Trump's latest executive order mandates that a new \"National Resilience Strategy\" be drafted, with the goal of \"reducing taxpayer burdens through efficiency.\" Project 2025, the conservative policy agenda organized by the Heritage Foundation, says the majority of disaster costs should be shouldered by the states. \"For far too long, state and local governments have neglected investing in resilience, infrastructure, and disaster preparedness because they can count on an unlimited backstop from the federal government — an unsustainable and irresponsible strategy that has resulted in needless destruction and deaths of everyday Americans,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an emailed statement. Still, many states don't want to see FEMA go away. The Trump administration's recent firings of more than 200 employees at FEMA are already likely to make the agency less able to handle future disasters. \"Our relationship with our federal partners is critical,\" North Carolina's Graney says. \"That relationship remains important and one we rely on.\" If the bulk of disaster response falls to states, some could struggle to keep up. While larger states like Florida and California have well-established emergency management offices, smaller states have few resources and staff, especially to prepare for disasters ahead of time. Infrastructure and landscape-scale projects that help protect communities from wildfires and floods are largely out of reach for local government budgets. \"Not every state had the capacity to do all the phases of emergency management, including preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation,\" says Knox. \"This is especially true in local counties in which there might be one person designated to do emergency management, especially in rural areas.\" Emergency management experts say there are areas where FEMA's disaster response efforts could be improved, especially in the complex and sometimes lengthy process for local governments to get funding for rebuilding. FEMA walks a difficult line, balancing distributing aid quickly with taking enough time to ensure there's no fraud or abuse. \"That is probably where we should be focusing most of our efforts is understanding the complexities that have developed in the way the federal government oversees money going to recovery efforts and making that simpler,\" Manning says. At a recent congressional hearing about FEMA, the director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, Jeffrey Smitherman, testified that it would be best for FEMA to handle giving out individual assistance. But he suggested that public assistance for local governments be given directly to states as a \"block grant,\" instead of being managed by FEMA. That could give states leeway to spend the money without federal oversight. Giving states funding directly also could mean that infrastructure is rebuilt with a patchwork of regulations. Under the Biden administration, projects getting federal funding were required to be built to a higher standard, constructed to withstand future flooding. The Trump administration had previously repealed that rule during its first term. Without federal guidelines to build with climate change in mind, experts say many states have little incentive to build projects better, since the financial responsibility for rebuilding after the next disaster largely falls on the federal government. \"It's malpractice as emergency managers, as government officials, to not plan for what might impact their citizens,\" Manny says. \"That's at the fundamental core of planning for disaster response.\"",

    "full_content": "The 7.7 magnitude earthquake rattled much of Southeast Asia on Friday. A powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake rattled much of Southeast Asia on Friday, resulting in mounting casualties and flattened skyscrapers from Myanmar to Thailand. The epicenter was in Mandalay, Myanmar, the country's second-largest city. Even Bangkok, some 600 miles away, felt widespread shaking and saw significant damage from the quake -- including the total collapse of a skyscraper under construction.   Casualties are expected to rise as search and rescue efforts are underway in collapsed buildings in Myanmar and Thailand, officials said. In Myanmar, the death toll has climbed to 2,056, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 people reported missing, according to the Myanmar Military Junta. In Bangkok, at least 13 people were killed in a building collapse in Chatuchak, according to the Bangkok Metro Authority. Reports from International Rescue Committee teams working in central Myanmar and Shan State reveal the staggering scale of humanitarian needs in the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake. IRC partners have started distributing essential support to the earthquake-hit communities, including water, hygiene kits and critical medical assistance. One of the IRC staff members working in Mandalay said they have “never experienced anything like this.”   “I have lived through several earthquakes in my life, but I have never experienced anything like this,” the staff member said. “The most powerful shaking lasted only a few seconds, and many people immediately ran out of their houses.” The staff member said many people are sleeping outside their homes on roads or open fields due to the fear of aftershocks. “There is an urgent need for tents, as even those whose homes remain intact are too afraid to sleep indoors,” the staff member said. A limited amount of water is available, telecommunication lines are “unreliable” and hospitals are overwhelmed with trauma cases, the staff member said. “Patients are being treated on beds placed outside due to fears of buildings collapsing,” the staff member said. Ciarán Donnelly, senior vice president of international programs at the IRC, told ABC News Live that teams are dealing with an “unimaginably horrendous situation on the ground,” with 80% of buildings destroyed in some towns. “The challenges are immense. You’ve got infrastructure that’s been destroyed, airports and roads that have been damaged, supply chains disrupted,” Donnelly said. -ABC News’ Will Gretsky International teams including China and Russia have already been on the ground responding to the increasingly desperate situation in Myanmar, filling the void in the U.S. absence.   Chinese teams arrived 18 hours after the earthquake, with more than 400 Chinese personnel now on the ground. On Monday, they rescued four people from collapsed buildings in Mandalay. Beijing has sent planes full of supplies, providing $14 million in aid. China also has multiple teams in Thailand. Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, said on X: “China, a friend in need.” -ABC News’ Britt Clennett The U.S. Embassy in Myanmar has announced up to $2 million to address humanitarian needs in the aftermath of last week’s earthquake, calling it part of the United States’ “immediate response” to the disaster. Additionally, a small U.S. Agency for International Development emergency response team has been deployed to assess the situation in Myanmar, but officials said that as of Monday morning, they had not yet been able to enter the country. Officials at the State Department said discussions regarding a more extensive response to the earthquake are ongoing, including the possibility of sending a Disaster Assistance Response Team. -ABC News’ Shannon K. Kingston In Myanmar, the death toll has climbed to 2,056, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 people reported missing, according to the Myanmar Military Junta. Myanmar State TV announced that seven days of national mourning begin on Monday.   The United Nations Special Envoy on Myanmar Julie Bishop called for “all sides” in Myanmar to “allow for humanitarian relief and ensure that aid workers can operate in safety,” in a statement to U.N. reporters issued Monday. “Continuing military operations in disaster-affected areas risks further loss of life and undermines the shared imperative to respond,” the statement added. -ABC News’ Joe Simonetti and Ellie Kaufman",

    "full_content": "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor. In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka. Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one. \"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve. But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say. It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives. Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events. For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Dr Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code. \"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\" With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning. The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows. The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction. It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur. Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Dr Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare. The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region. While the guess was correct, Dr Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy. There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Dr Jones said. The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet. Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\". The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come. Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis. While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region. Dr Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them. \"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\" Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade. The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.  But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.  At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030. While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur. \"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\" This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Dr Jones said. \"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said. \"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\" But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said. Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out. It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Dr Jones.  During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute. The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries. If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami. \"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division. Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert. The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

    "full_content": "State Department says dismantling USAID has not limited the U.S. response. As a U.S. team of experts heads to Myanmar to assist in recovery from the devastating earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people in Southeast Asia on Friday, international teams, including those from China and Russia, are filling the void in the U.S. absence. The U.S. said Monday that it would provide $2 million in aid and a small U.S. Agency for International Development emergency response team has been deployed to assess the situation in Myanmar, but officials said that it had not yet been able to enter the country as of Monday morning. While the dollar amount of initial aid is in line with what the U.S. has pledged in the past, the overall pace of the response has been slower. In the aftermath of the 2023 earthquake in Morocco, for example, a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team was deployed just hours later, although Morocco did not ultimately ask for DARTs. That same year when Libya endured catastrophic flooding, DARTs were deployed the same day. And when a major earthquake struck Turkey and Syria that same year, the DART teams were also launched just a few hours after the disaster hit. In both cases, the DARTs took a few days to get on the ground. The U.S. response comes amid President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle USAID, laying off thousands of employees, revoking funding for more than 80% of its programs and closing its headquarters, although those efforts are being challenged in multiple court cases. On Friday, the State Department announced it was officially shuttering the agency and taking over “many of USAID's functions and its ongoing programming.\" The State Department has pushed back on the assessment that cuts to USAID have limited the earthquake response, but officials say there has been at least some logistical impact caused by the reorganization, rather than a lack of funding. “I would reject the notion this is obviously a result of the USAID cuts and that kind of funding,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Monday. “We’re certainly in the region.” In the meantime, it was Chinese teams that arrived 18 hours after the quake and more than 400 Chinese personnel are now on the ground in the region. Beijing has sent in planes full of supplies, providing $14 million in aid. China also has multiple teams in Thailand. It’s a public relations win for China, showing it can be a reliable partner when its neighbors are in crisis. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Monday posted on X photos and videos of Chinese workers on the ground, rescuing survivors and delivering supplies, saying, “China, a friend in need.” A leading aid group said in a statement to ABC News on Tuesday that the U.S. has already “missed the first urgent window to help find survivors.” Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, blamed the Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID for what she characterized as the U.S.’s “severely compromised” emergency response. \"For decades, the US Government has responded to sudden onset emergencies primarily by providing humanitarian support through USAID. With USAID effectively gutted and critical staff receiving their final notices in the midst of an emergency, the US Government’s ability to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar and future crises is severely compromised,\" Maxman said. \"Speed, collaboration, and resources are life and death matters when disaster strikes. The illegal decision to dismantle USAID means the U.S. will be unable to show up like it has in past emergencies.\" At the site where a high-rise building collapsed on Sunday in Bangkok, a group of U.S. military personnel were coming and going from the search area throughout Monday. The American team is working with Israeli soldiers to search for survivors, sending drones into areas too dangerous for rescue workers to reach. “We’re learning a lot from the Americans, and they’re bringing in a lot of good equipment,” said Choktong Issarangkool, one of the volunteers in the rescue and search teams who is also acting as a translator for the American teams. Thais say they are grateful for the American assistance, something this region has become accustomed to following a natural disaster: U.S. aid teams have always been among the first on the ground to help. State Department officials said discussions regarding a more extensive response to the earthquake are ongoing, including the possibility of sending a DART team, although it might be smaller than in past efforts. “Our disaster experts, including those based in Bangkok, Manila and Washington, D.C., continue to monitor the situation with coordination with U.S. government counterparts in the region,” Bruce said. She emphasized that the $2 million of initial support would be implemented through partner organizations that were already working in the impacted areas. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "full_content": "BANGKOK — A powerful earthquake rocked Myanmar on Friday, causing extensive damage across a wide swath of one of the world’s poorest countries and prompting officials to warn that the initial death toll — above 140 — was likely to grow in the days ahead. In neighboring Thailand, at least six died in Bangkok, where a high-rise under construction collapsed. The full extent of death, injury and destruction was not immediately clear — particularly in Myanmar, which is embroiled in a civil war, and where information is tightly controlled. Advertisement Advertisement “The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,” the head of Myanmar’s military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said as he announced on television that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others were injured in his country. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand In Thailand, authorities in Bangkok said six people were killed, 22 were injured and 101 were missing from three construction sites, including the high-rise. They revised the death toll Saturday morning from 10 reported the previous day, saying several critically injured people were mistakenly reported dead. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said that more people were believed to be alive in the wreckage as search efforts continued Saturday morning. The 7.7 magnitude quake struck at midday, with an epicenter near Mandalay, Myanmar ’s second-largest city. Aftershocks followed, one of them measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude. Myanmar is in an active earthquake belt, though many of the temblors happen in sparsely populated areas, not cities like those affected Friday. The U.S. Geological Survey, an American government science agency, estimated that the death toll could top 1,000. In Mandalay, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including one of the city’s largest monasteries. Photos from the capital city of Naypyidaw showed rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of multiple buildings used to house civil servants. Myanmar's government said blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept assistance. A 37-member team from the Chinese province of Yunnan reached the city of Yangon early Saturday with earthquake detectors, drones and other supplies, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Russia’s emergencies ministry dispatched two planes carrying 120 rescuers and supplies, according to a report from the Russian state news agency Tass. India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team as well as blankets, tarpaulin, hygiene kits, sleeping bags, solar lamps, food packets and kitchen sets, the country’s foreign minister posted on X. Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country will send 50 people on Sunday to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas. The United Nations allocated $5 million to start relief efforts. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response, but some experts were concerned about this effort given his administration’s deep cuts in foreign assistance. But amid images of buckled and cracked roads and reports of a collapsed bridge and a burst dam, there were concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a humanitarian crisis. “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,\" said Mohammed Riyas, the International Rescue Committee’s Myanmar director. Myanmar's English-language state newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said five cities and towns had seen building collapses and two bridges had fallen, including one on a key highway between Mandalay and Yangon. A photo on the newspaper’s website showed wreckage of a sign that read “EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT,\" which the caption said was part of the capital’s main 1,000-bed hospital. Elsewhere, video posted online showed robed monks in a Mandalay street, shooting their own video of the multistory Ma Soe Yane monastery before it suddenly fell into the ground. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed. Video also showed damage to the former royal palace. Christian Aid said its partners and colleagues on the ground reported that a dam burst in the city, causing water levels to rise in the lowland areas. Residents of Yangon, the nation's largest city, rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. In Naypyitaw, some homes stood partly crumbled, while rescuers heaved away bricks from the piles of debris. An injured man reclined on a wheeled stretcher, while another man fanned him in the heat. In a country where many people already were struggling, “this disaster will have left people devastated,” said Julie Mehigan, who oversees Christian Aid’s work in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. “Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,” Mehigan said. Myanmar's military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones. Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. In Thailand, a 33-story building under construction crumpled into a cloud of dust near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market, and onlookers could be seen screaming and running in a video posted on social media. Vehicles on a nearby freeway came to a stop. Sirens blared across the Thai capital's downtown as a rescuers streamed to the wreckage. Above them, shredded steel and broken concrete blocks, some stacked like pancakes, rose in a towering heap. Injured people were rushed away on gurneys, and hospital beds were also wheeled outside onto a sidewalk. “It’s a great tragedy,\" Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said after viewing the site. Earthquakes are rarely felt in the Bangkok metropolitan area, home to more than 17 million people, many of whom live in high-rise apartments. Voranoot Thirawat, a lawyer working in central Bangkok, said she first realized something was wrong when she saw a light swinging back and forth. Then she heard the building creaking, and she and her colleagues fled down 12 flights of stairs. “In my lifetime, there was no earthquake like this in Bangkok,” she said. Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland, was in one of Bangkok’s many malls when the quake struck. “All of a sudden, the whole building began to move. Immediately, there was screaming and a lot of panic,” he said. Some people fled down upward-moving escalators, he said. Nearby, Paul Vincent, a tourist visiting from England, recalled seeing a high-rise building swaying, water falling from a rooftop pool and people crying in the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ center for geosciences said the earthquake was a shallow 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to preliminary reports. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more damage. To the northeast, the earthquake was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused damage and injuries in the city of Ruili on the border with Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports. The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. —Adam Schreck, Haruka Naga, Jerry Harmer, Grant Peck and Penny Wang in Bangkok, Jamey Keaten in Geneva, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Edith M.

Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Overnight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls \"major flood stage,\" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. There were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. Interstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts, twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. \"We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,\" he said. \n                A flooded home is seen from the banks of the Ohio River on Saturday in Louisville, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. Hundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. Downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said. \"We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,\" Knight said. \"Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.\" In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding. BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen. \n                The rising waters of the Licking River touch the basketball hoop at Max Goldberg Park, Saturday, April 5, 2025, in Falmouth, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Since Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage. \"I grabbed all my stuff and came here,\" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: \"I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.\"",

    "full_content": "Fighting has been reported in Myanmar despite the military junta and a rebel group alliance announcing temporary ceasefires to support earthquake relief. As of Friday, the military had carried out at least 14 attacks since the ceasefire, according to reports received by the UN Human Rights office. The military accused two rebel groups in the alliance that declared a ceasefire of carrying out attacks. One group said fighting broke out in response to \"offensives\" by the military.  Maj Gen Zaw Min Tun, military council spokesman, issued a general statement saying \"we will respond if military bases are attacked without reason\". An army spokesman did not respond to BBC Burmese's request for comment.  UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk urged \"a halt to all military operations\" and a focus \"on assisting those impacted by the quake, as well as ensuring unhindered access to humanitarian organisations\" following the 7.7 magnitude quake on 28 March. A civil war has been ongoing between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. The military council declared a 20-day ceasefire on 2 April, after the alliance made up of three rebel groups had announced one. The official death toll from the earthquake in Myanmar rose to 3,564 on Monday, according to state media. Another 5,012 people were injured and 210 people remain missing. More than a week after the earthquake, rescue workers were recovering bodies from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Mandalay over the weekend, state media reported. Rain also fell over the weekend, which aid groups said could hamper relief efforts. The UN Human Rights office said on Friday that while humanitarian efforts had progressed in areas where access had been granted, \"longstanding limitations imposed by the military on humanitarian operations and access\" meant that multiple badly affected areas \"have remained inaccessible to humanitarian emergency assistance – except for what can be organised locally by residents\". UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said in a video filmed in Mandalay on Saturday that people \"need food. They need water. They need the power back on. They're telling me that they need shelter\". Aftershocks continue, with a 4.9 magnitude earthquake recorded over the weekend, and people are \"living with that trauma\", he said. Before the earthquake, almost 20 million people were already in need in this community, he added. \"So it's a compounding crisis. It's earthquake, on top of conflict, on top of huge existing need,\" he said.",

    "full_content": "In the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, there is a 72-hour \"golden window\" when those trapped under rubble are most likely to survive. But in the 72 hours after a 7.7 magnitude quake struck Myanmar on Friday, rescue and relief workers seeking access to some of the worst-hit areas were blocked by military authorities, multiple aid and human rights groups told the BBC. This was despite a rare plea for international humanitarian assistance by junta chief Min Aung Hlaing. \"I would like to invite any country, any organisation, or anyone in Myanmar to come and help,\" he said in a speech shortly after the disaster, claiming he had \"opened all ways for foreign aid\". On the ground, things moved less freely. \"I've talked to a few people now that were part of the rescue efforts in both Sagaing and Mandalay, and they said that [the military] imposed a curfew… the roads were blocked, the checkpoints were really long, and there was a huge checking of goods and services going in and a lot of questioning,\" John Quinley, director of international human rights group Fortify Rights, told the BBC. \"It could have just been a lot easier to allow those people in,\" he added. \"Obviously the Myanmar junta said it was for safety reasons, but I don't believe that's totally legitimate.\" Meanwhile, the golden window closed. At the time of writing, more than 2,886 people in Myanmar are confirmed dead as a result of the earthquake. On Tuesday night, an attack on an aid convoy further exacerbated concerns. At 21:21, a convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross Society vehicles carrying earthquake relief supplies was attacked by the military, according to Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), a resistance group in Shan State. The convoy was traveling toward Mandalay when it was fired upon by soldiers with machine guns, forcing it to turn back, the TNLA said in a Telegram post late on Tuesday. A junta spokesperson later confirmed that soldiers had shot at the vehicles, saying they had not been notified that the convoy would be passing through and fired warning shots after it failed to stop. But this is not the first time the junta has attacked aid workers, Mr Quinley said. \"They pick and choose when aid can go in, and if they can't monitor it and they can't use it how they want, they restrict it,\" he said. \"They definitely also, on top of that, actively target humanitarian workers.\"  The junta, which began fighting a civil war with resistance forces in Myanmar after it seized control of the country in 2021, has a history of weaponising aid and humanitarian assistance: funnelling it towards areas that are under its control and restricting it in areas that are not. The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November last year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict. In previous natural disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Typhoon Yagi in 2024, which left hundreds dead, the military obstructed relief efforts in resistance-held areas by refusing to release supplies from customs, authorise travel for aid workers or relax restrictions on lifesaving assistance. \"It's a worrying trend that happens in times of crisis, like the earthquake,\" Mr Quinley said. \"The junta is blocking any aid to what they see as groups that are aligned with the broader resistance.\" James Rodehaver, head of the Myanmar team at the Office for the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, further suggested that the junta deprives Myanmar's population of aid as a form of punishment. \"They do that because the local population, by and large, does not support them, so by depriving them of humanitarian aid, they are both punishing them but also cutting off their ability to support themselves and be resilient,\" he told the BBC. There are already signs the junta may be repeating this tactic in Sagaing. Although central Myanmar, which includes the cities of Sagaing and Mandalay, is nominally run by the junta - meaning aid can only be delivered to the area with their co-operation - large parts of the broader Sagaing and Mandalay regions are considered resistance strongholds. The likelihood that the junta might tactically deprive these areas of aid has prompted outcry from hundreds of human rights and civil society organisations, who have urged the international community to ensure relief efforts get to where they're most needed, and aren't channelled through the military government. One such statement, signed by 265 civil society organisations and released on Sunday, notes that most of the worst-hit areas are under the effective control and administration of pro-democracy resistance groups. \"Myanmar's history provides stark warnings about the dangers of channelling aid through the military junta,\" it reads. In Sagaing, the impact of aid shortfalls can already be seen in troubling ways, according to relief agencies. They speak of shortages of food, water and fuel, while trucks carrying aid are stranded at military checkpoints around the city. Hundreds of residents, suddenly homeless, are sleeping outside on the street. Rescue volunteers who were forced to dig through the rubble with their bare hands have run out of body bags for those they couldn't save. Other community members seeking to respond to the earthquake are being forced to get authorisation from junta authorities by submitting lists of volunteers and items to be donated, local media reported. This tactic – of bombarding responders with lengthy bureaucratic checklists and processes – is routinely deployed by the junta to restrict the activities of international aid organisations in Myanmar, humanitarian sources told the BBC. According to a registration law imposed in 2023, such organisations must attain a registration certificate, and often sign a memorandum of understanding with relevant government ministries, to legally operate inside the country. One source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said aid groups are often required to remove certain activities, areas or townships from their proposals, with no room for negotiation. Areas where the junta doesn't have oversight or control over the aid work are typically those that are disallowed, they added. Aid agencies have found ways to navigate the junta's restriction, however: a lot of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar happens underground, via local groups that can bypass checkpoints and distribute aid without attracting the attention of the authorities. Many financial transactions in humanitarian aid also happen outside of Myanmar's banking system, so that actors can avoid scrutiny and potential investigation from the country's central bank, a source told the BBC. In some cases, humanitarian organisations open bank accounts in Thailand so that they can privately receive aid funds, then carry the money over the border into Myanmar in cash. Such covert methods take time, however, and could lead to potentially fatal delays of days or weeks.  Some aid workers are hopeful that, given the scale of Friday's earthquake and the international appeal for assistance by Min Aung Hlaing, it may be easier to overcome barriers and provide aid more efficiently. \"In the past we have faced some challenges,\" said Louise Gorton, an emergency specialist based in Unicef's East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. \"The scale of this emergency, though, is significantly higher… I think there will be pressure on the regime to ensure unfettered and unimpeded humanitarian access - and we'll continue to repeat the same need and find ways, sometimes low-key ways, to deliver aid.\" Another aid worker, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while it's too early to tell whether the junta will truly \"open all ways for foreign aid\", their team is prepared to navigate the complex humanitarian situation to deliver assistance. \"It's certainly a concern that they [the military] may direct the aid in specific places, and not based on need.\" \"But as humanitarian actors [our organisation] works under a humanitarian mandate, and will be very focused on getting aid to the places it needs to go - to the hardest-hit areas, regardless of who controls them.\" Early indications suggest that, despite Min Aung Hlaing's plea to the international community, the embattled junta leader is unlikely to prioritise the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.  Shortly after the earthquake, military jets launched a series of airstrikes on affected areas, killing more than 50 civilians, according to the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC). Then, on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing rejected ceasefire proposals that were put forward by resistance groups in a bid to facilitate aid. Military operations would continue as \"necessary protective measures\", he said. The junta changed its mind a day later, agreeing to a 20-day ceasefire to help relief efforts. But it remains to be seen whether the pause in hostilities will hold. The military stressed it would \"respond accordingly\" if rebels launched attacks. For many onlookers, this seeming contradiction - of asking for aid with one hand while conducting military strikes with the other - chimes with Min Aung Hlaing's history of duplicity. John Quinley, from Fortify Rights, noted that the junta leader has \"lied on numerous occasions\" - and suggested that the recent appeal for foreign aid is more likely an appeal for international recognition. Against that backdrop, Mr Quinley added, it's critical to ensure earthquake relief gets to where it is most needed. \"I think as a human rights group we need to monitor: OK, [Min Aung Hlaing] allows aid in - but is it actually reaching people in need? Or is he weaponising the aid? Is he blocking the aid from getting to communities in need?\" he said. \"I'm not hopeful when it comes to taking what Min Aung Hlaing says with any hint of truth.\"",

    "full_content": "Days after multiple tornadoes tore through the state, parts of Tennessee are bracing for a possible once in a 1,000 year rain event. A storm system is ripping through the central United States, potentially dropping more than 10 inches of rain in some communities, including in parts of West Tennessee. The latest predictions from AccuWeather, the storm is expected to dump the equivalent of up to four months' worth of rain over a five-day period. \"Should the amount of rain occur that we anticipate over the middle of the nation, it would exceed the 500 to 1,000-year average,\" AccuWeather meteorologist William Clark said, \"Truly, the potential is there for a historic flash flooding event.\" This rain event and other storm systems are expected to impact a 1,000-mile swath from Texas to Ohio, according to Accuweather. Parts of the U.S. could see \"generational\" rain amounts and, along with it, flash floods and even possibly tornadoes. “People who have lived in a community their entire lives may see water rapidly rising and flooding areas they have never seen flood before,\" AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. \"Do not assume that if you have not seen flooding in an area before, that it will not occur this time.” Here's how Tennessee is expected to fare as this \"generational\" rain event moves across the U.S. Where is 'Dixie Alley'? Term looks at shift in 'tornado alley' to the southeast Western Tennessee is expected to get the brunt of these storm systems, with some meteorologist predicting upwards of a foot of rain to fall in the Memphis area over the next five days. The National Weather Service also expects areas of the mid-Mississippi and lower Ohio valleys to see a tornado outbreak starting Wednesday into the night. A tornado outbreak is expected today and tonight from parts of the mid Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys westward into the eastern Ozarks. Numerous tornadoes, along with multiple long-track EF3+ tornadoes appear likely. In addition, tornadoes, severe wind gusts, and large hail… pic.twitter.com/Uv39fjwK0O Here are the different hazardous weather advisories already in place by the weather service: Memphis, West Tennessee: Wind advisory until midnight on Wednesday and a flood watch until 7 a.m. Sunday, April 6. Nashville, Middle Tennessee: Wind advisory until 4 a.m. on Thursday, April 3, and a flood watch until 7 a.m. Sunday, April 6. The National Weather Service warns that Tennesseans in these communities should be prepared for severe weather, including the potential for significant rain, flash flooding, large hail, straight line winds and even tornadoes. We are still forecasting a severe threat for this evening and overnight. All modes of severe weather remain possible today, including damaging winds, large hail, tornadoes, & flooding.NOW is the time to make sure you have multiple ways to receive warnings! (2/6) pic.twitter.com/rOoikJR0lD West and Middle Tennessee are expected to see rain starting late Wednesday afternoon and it will continue through the weekend. Significant rain is expected during this time, and communities in Middle and West Tennessee should be prepared for possible flooding during this event. Here's how many inches of rain are predicted for some areas as of Wednesday morning. Union City: 10-15 inches Along and north of I-40 in West Tennessee: 10-15 inches Memphis, Shelby County: 8-10 inches Clarksville: 8-10 inches Stewart, Montgomery, and Houston counties: 6-10 inches Waverly: 6-8 inches Nashville: 5-6 inches East Tennessee will be spared the brunt of the storm but could see rain and severe storms this weekend. The National Weather Service out of Memphis referred to these storm systems' potential to bring \"generational flooding\" to the area. This usually refers to an event that usually only happens once in a generation...or a once-in-a-lifetime event. People in East Tennessee and western North Carolina saw similar flooding after Tropical Storm Helene dumped massive amounts of rain in those communities, which caused rivers to crest to historic levels and cut a swath of destruction that has forever changed those communities. Keep up to date with the latest weather warnings below. When a tornado watch is in place tornadoes are possible in and near the watch area, according to the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service suggests people who are in the warning area review and discuss their emergency plans, check supplies and have a safe room incase the weather takes a turn for the worse. When a tornado warning is issued, it means a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. There is imminent danger to life and property. Here are some suggestions from the National Weather Service if a tornado warning is issued for your area: Warnings typically are for a much smaller area that may be impacted by a tornado identified by a forecaster on radar, a trained spotter or law enforcement who is watching the storm, according to the National Weather Service. Tornado warnings are issued by your local forecast office. Flash flooding usually begins within six hours, but often within three hours, of heavy rain or mass amounts of water accumulating in an area, according to the National Weather Service. This type of flooding usually happens very quickly and catches people off guard. It can be caused by a number of things, but is often due to extremely heavy rainfall from thunderstorms. \"The intensity of the rainfall, the location and distribution of the rainfall, the land use and topography, vegetation types and growth/density, soil type, and soil water-content all determine just how quickly the flash flooding may occur, and influence where it may occur,\" writes the National Weather Service. A flood watch and a flood warning are two different things. Here's the difference. A flood watch indicates that the conditions are favorable to flooding in an area that is under a watch. These flood watches are usually issued hours and even days ahead of the weather event that could cause the flooding.  A flood warning means that the flooding that could be harmful and poses a serious threat to property and people is expected. This too can be issued hours and days ahead of time based on forecast predictions. Anytime flooding is a risk people should use caution. Water levels can change rapidly during periods of heavy rainfall. This story was updated to add a video and gallery.",

    "full_content": "Towards the end of last year, we learned that a group (allegedly affiliated with the Chinese government, referred to as “Salt Typhoon”) breached T-Mobile and other telecommunications companies and caused all sorts of havoc. This isn’t really a blog post about that incident, but it was the catalyst that inspired a bit of curiosity within me. I can’t (legally) access most mobile phone companies’ networks to see what vulnerabilities I can find, but there are plenty of open source software projects related to telecommunications on GitHub. So when I heard about the Salt Typhoon hacks, I wondered, “Is any of this open source telecom software any good?” In a previous life, I worked with companies that used Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, but I’d never really looked into them beyond the surface-level familiarity congruent to “this uses a similar protocol as RedPhone, somewhere” (this was when Signal was still called TextSecure). I don’t know much about PBX systems, SIP, or even audio encoding. Furthermore, some of the best C programmers I’ve ever met worked in telecom. Hell, some of the longest-running hacker communities have their roots in phone phreaking from the 1980s. Not to mention all the legendary engineers that trace their roots to Bell Labs. This is all to say, I thought looking at this sort of software would be a fruitless endeavor.  Surely all of the low-hanging fruit would be found already? Thus, I opened FreeSWITCH’s source code on GitHub and almost immediately found a vulnerability. In this excerpt of code, the HTTP request handler for the XMLRPC library bundled with FreeSWITCH writes an arbitrary-length URI to a 4096-byte stack variable called z. The uri variable is populated by the path part of the Request URI, which is attacker-provided. This is not typically a problem, since most browsers don’t support URLs longer than 2048 characters, but the relevant RFCs support up to about 8 KB in most cases. (CloudFlare supports up to 32KB.) I think it’s reasonable to assume that attackers are capable of sending a Request URI longer than 4096 characters. Putting these observations together, it’s pretty easy to see this is a no-auth buffer overflow in their XMLRPC library.  Turning this into remote code execution is an exercise left to the reader (mostly because I’m not really up-to-date on OS-level exploit mitigation techniques, and how to bypass them). Use snprintf() instead. This is kind of “defensive C programming practices 101” level. (n.b., Please stop saying “responsible” disclosure.) 2025-01-27: I send an email on to the email address listed on FreeSWITCH’s security policy with the details of the vulnerability. 2025-02-07: I send a follow-up email to ensure they received my report. 2025-02-07: Andrey Volk responds: Hello Soatok. Thank you for your email! Issues you describe were recently fixed. Please see: https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/pull/2752 https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/pull/2753 https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/pull/2754 Best regards, Since the fixes are now public, I’m left to assume that “embargo has broken,” so to speak. That means I’m free to blog about this publicly. However, I notice they haven’t tagged a new release with this security fix for FreeSWITCH users. I reply: Oh, wonderful. Thanks for getting back to me. Do you have an ETA on when the release will be tagged? I don’t want to publish anything until people can easily install an updated version. A few hours later, Andrey responds to my email. Brace yourselves, it’s a stupid one. … Hello Soatok. Thank you for your interest in FreeSWITCH. We do not have plans to make a release of FreeSWITCH Community till summer 2025. Best regards, To recap: An employee of SignalWire (which develops FreeSWITCH) came right out and said they would let people who aren’t paying for FreeSWITCH Advantage stay vulnerable until their regularly scheduled release (sometime in the Summer). There are about 8,300 hits on Shodan for FreeSWITCH as I write this. I highly doubt they’re all paying for enterprise support, so we’re talking about potentially thousands of telecom stacks around the world that SignalWire has decided to keep vulnerable until the Summer, even after they published the patches on GitHub. While such a decision might be perfectly legal, it really does not inspire trust in the stewards of this software project to give a shit about the harm their careless coding practices inflict upon their users. The worst part is, when I confided in a friend that works in telecom (after SignalWire published the fixes, of course) about this carnival-quality vulnerability management from the FreeSWITCH developers, their response was: That fast? […] December 2024 is the last time that alarms were once again raised about known SS7 vulnerabilities that have continued to exist in telephone networks for the past 17 years. And, to be honest, that kind of took the wind out of my sails so I didn’t bother looking at Asterisk or any of the other software. I mean, why bother? I already had the answer to the question that prompted me to look in the first place: Telecom security sucks today. The reason things sucks is largely because there’s very little (if any) money to be made in securing these systems today. Things don’t have to be this way, of course. Maybe there’s some opportunity for some enterprising young hacker to write a FreeSWITCH competitor in Rust that has sane vulnerability management around it. (Or, at least, is marginally harder to find vulnerabilities in than Damn Vulnerable Web Application. Maybe the OpenBSD team can be inspired to act?) Maybe in the future, we’ll find the political will to invest in the security of America’s telecommunications infrastructure. Who knows, some of that money might even percolate towards open source software, and they can hire someone who knows how to run valgrind. Or maybe everything will continue to suck, because incentives rule anything, and there currently aren’t any to do better. It took me a long time to write this one up, despite it being a rather simple technical issue, because I’m sure there are eldritch horrors lurking beneath the surface of this relatively simple finding. The vendor’s response was pretty lame, yeah. But is this vendor the lamest in their industry? I’m not so sure about that one. At least they responded within 90 days and fixed the issue on their GitHub. But, hey, if you’re waiting on SignalWire to get around to running git tag… maybe rebuild from source or block public HTTP access to your FreeSWITCH stack at the firewall level? Sorry I can’t help more.  Security engineer with a fursona. Ask me about dholes or Diffie-Hellman!",

The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that communities should prepare for two more days of excessive rainfall, which could lead to additional \"historic\" flooding. At least eight people have already lost their lives due to the severe storm systems, including a young boy in Frankfort, Ky., who was swept away by floodwaters while walking to his school bus, according to the state's governor, Andy Beshear. Kentucky, I have some tough news to share. This morning in Frankfort, a child died after being swept away by floodwaters. My heart breaks for this family. Please join Britainy and me in praying for them following this unimaginable loss. 1/2 \"We need everyone to understand that all water poses a risk right now. Let's do everything possible to keep our loved ones safe,\" Beshear wrote on X. Frankfort Police have identified the boy as 9-year-old Gabriel Andrews. \"We would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family of this young boy,\" Assistant Chief of Police Scott Tracy said during a press conference. \"Our prayers are with them.\" Beshear also offered his condolences, stating, \"My heart breaks for the family.\" He urged the community to pray for Gabriel's family, highlighting that this tragedy underscores just how dangerous floodwaters can be. Among the other victims of the recent severe weather is 68-year-old Garry Moore from Missouri.  Missouri State Highway Patrol authorities informed local media that Moore was the chief of the Whitewater Fire Protection District and was killed while assisting a stranded motorist.  In Indiana, the Hendricks County Sheriff's Office reported the death of a 27-year-old man who died after coming into contact with downed power lines on the road. His name has not yet been released. Additionally, officials in Tennessee reported five other fatalities attributed to the severe weather. During a press conference on Thursday evening, Gov. Bill Lee described a tornado that tore through the area as causing \"immense devastation.\" Kentucky, as well as Tennessee, have been approved for federal disaster relief as a result of the storms. Arkansas, which has been heavily impacted by the severe weather, has requested approval for FEMA relief. Areas around 45 river locations are expected to reach major flood stage, and an additional 112 are expected to reach moderate flood stage, according to the NWS.

Some areas could see up to 10-15 inches of rain. \"This will especially be the case for the Lower Ohio Valley into the Mid-South and Lower Mississippi Valley, where the necessary ingredients of moisture, instability, forcing, and wind shear best overlap,\" the agency said.   In severe weather conditions, forcing or lift mechanisms, such as a cold front, dry line, or terrain, are needed to trigger rising air and initiate thunderstorm development. These same conditions have also contributed to severe tornadoes that have ravaged the region, leaving entire communities devastated in their aftermath.

    "full_content": "A huge 7.7 magnitude earthquake has hit central Myanmar, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). At least 144 people have died and 732 have been injured so far in the country, Myanmar military leader Min Aung Hlaing said. The epicentre was 16km (10 miles) north-west of the city of Sagaing, sending strong tremors that were felt as far as south-west China and Thailand. Meanwhile, around 100 construction workers are missing after an unfinished high-rise building collapsed hundreds of miles away in Bangkok, according to Thailand's deputy prime minister. At least seven people have died at the site in Thailand, according to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. A rescuer in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, told the BBC the damage is \"enormous\".  The total number of people killed and injured by the earthquake are expected to rise in the coming days. There have been reports of roads buckling in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw, and the country's military government has declared a state of emergency in six regions. The earthquake struck near Mandalay, which has a population of about 1.5 million people.  A second quake struck 12 minutes after the first, according to the USGS, with a magnitude of 6.4 and its epicentre was 18km (11.1 miles) south of Sagaing. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gained independence from Britain in 1948, but its recent history has been marked by unrest and conflict. The military seized power in 2021, ten years after agreeing to hand over control to a civilian government. Since then, the junta has cracked down hard on dissent, executing democracy activists and jailing journalists. The state controls almost all local radio, television, print and online media, and Internet use is restricted in the country, which often makes access to information difficult. According to a recent BBC data project, the country is now controlled by a patchwork of groups, making relief and recovery efforts more challenging.  It is even harder to find accurate information about what is going on in rebel-held areas of the country. The junta made a rare call for international assistance in the wake of the earthquake.  However, the complex situation on the ground is likely to hamper search and rescue operations as well as the free flow of aid into the country. Rescue workers operating in villages near Mandalay have told the BBC they do not have access to the heavy machinery needed to reach people trapped under the rubble. \"We're digging people out with our bare hands,\" one man said. The earthquake has added pressure to an already dire humanitarian situation in the country, where 3.5m people are estimated to have been displaced by fighting. The Sagaing region, near the epicentre of the quake, is a volatile key battleground in the civil war. Charities and opposition parties working in the country have raised concerns about the \"politicisation\" of aid in the coming days.  Montse Ferrer, the deputy director of East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific at Amnesty International, told the BBC the junta has \"a history of denying aid\" to areas where resistance forces are active. The tremors were felt hundreds of miles away in Thailand's capital of Bangkok, where rescue teams worked through the night to free the construction workers trapped beneath the rubble. Buildings across the city were evacuated, including a hospital holding patients in acute need of medical attention. A woman gave birth on the street amid the commotion, lying on a stretcher surrounded by hospital staff. Bui Thu, a BBC journalist who lives in Bangkok, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme that she was at home cooking when the initial quake happened. \"I was very nervous, I was very panicked,\" she said.  \"Buildings in Bangkok are not engineered for earthquakes, so I think that's why I think there's going to be big damage.\" Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra visited the site of the collapsed building on Friday afternoon.  Search and rescue teams using drones, sniffer dogs and diggers have been mobilised and disaster centres set up to help with the rescue operation.

    "full_content": "Chinese automaker BYD continues to leave Tesla in the dust. The company introduced a new battery system on Monday that it claims can charge an electric vehicle in just five minutes, about the same time it takes to refuel a combustion car. The feat has long been a goal of the industry, which is still trying to overcome thorny hurdles around charging that have held potential buyers back. The company specifically claims it can provide 249 miles of range in 5 minutes in its new Han L sedan. That compares to Tesla’s best charging rate, which can add 170 miles of range in 15 minutes at one of its high-voltage Superchargers. Elon Musk years ago bet big on an in-house battery to provide extended range to his company’s vehicles, but seemingly found battery development is harder than expected, as the 4860 battery has not lived up to expectations. BYDâs stock rose on the news to reach a market value of roughly $158 billion. It is up approximately 58% so far this year. There has been some concern raised that fast charging such as that from BYD could shorten the overall lifespan of an EV battery, but there is little evidence thus far to support that idea. There are also concerns about how such charging could strain electrical grids. The CEO of major Chinese battery maker CATL last year said Musk “doesn’t know how to make a battery” in an interview with Reuters. BYD, now the leading EV maker in China, was founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturing company, and only later entered the automotive market as it saw the future of cars would be as computers on wheels. It also assembles iPads for Apple. The company makes EVs at a range of prices, with its most affordable Seagull coming in at a starting price of just $9,700. It has been expanding across the world into markets like Europe and South America, building China’s soft power by creating local jobs and proving it can be successful outside the domestic Chinese market. This all comes as Musk looks to handicap U.S. automotive companies by getting rid of subsidies that were helping the industry transition. Critics of China have complained that it uses subsidies to flood foreign markets with cheap products, but BYD is profitable on EVs now, and U.S. automakers could do the same if they had more time to reach scale. America was once a leader in automotive globally, but has decided to cede that position to China in favor of AI and crypto. The transition to EVs has come with more growing pains than many in the industry expected, as charging infrastructure has been slow to expand and available chargers are frequently broken or slow. The existing infrastructure around gas-powered vehicles was developed over decades, however, and it makes sense it would similarly take time for EVs to reach maturity. Fast-charging capabilities could placate drivers who do not want to sit at chargers for a long time. Besides leapfrogging Tesla on price and battery performance, BYD also recently announced it will be adding advanced self-driving features to all of its vehicles. Reviewers have lauded BYDâs system for its performance. It should all serve as a reminder that Tesla’s current valuation does not make a lot of sense. Sales have been cratering globally, the company sells fewer vehicles than BMW at lower profit margins, its vehicle lineup is dated, and full autonomy is years late. But Musk has pivoted to self-driving robocabs and robotics to keep the valuation afloat. Tesla stock has fallen 40% since the start of 2025 in part over intense backlash to Muskâs close involvement in the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Ross Gerber, one of Tesla’s most loyal investors called for Musk to step down from his position as CEO at the company. Perhaps if he was not spending all his time in Washington, Musk would have more time for Tesla, once the leader in electric vehicles but now second-tier compared to BYD. The power and proximity to President Trump is more valuable to him, it seems.

Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Overnight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls \"major flood stage,\" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. There were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. Interstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts, twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. \"We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,\" he said. \n                A flooded home is seen from the banks of the Ohio River on Saturday in Louisville, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. Hundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. Downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said. \"We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,\" Knight said. \"Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.\" In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding. BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen. \n                The rising waters of the Licking River touch the basketball hoop at Max Goldberg Park, Saturday, April 5, 2025, in Falmouth, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Since Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage. \"I grabbed all my stuff and came here,\" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: \"I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.\"",

    "full_content": "There is some bad news for folks who like $2 t-shirts and jeans that fall apart after three uses: President Trump is ending the “de minimis” trade exemption that enabled Temu and SHEIN to ship goods to the United States without paying any import duties. President Trump already cancelled the exemption once before, only to reinstate it because U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were overwhelmed by the flood of new packages they would have to inspect. But an executive order signed on Tuesday officially ends the exemption on May 2. Under the new rules, goods that have previously qualified for the exemption will be subject to a duty of either 30% of their value or $25 per item, whichever is higher. On June 1, the duty will increase to $50. Temu and SHEIN will either need to raise prices or send more goods in bulk to be stored in U.S. warehouses, which is something the latter has already been working on, with distribution centers opening in several states. Temu for its part has been adding US-based sellers to its marketplace and steering customers there. Which is to say, the onslaught of garbage, disposable goods containing toxic chemicals and produced on slave labor wages likely will not end with this executive order. Temu and SHEIN can be thought of best as H&M or Forever 21 on steroids. The discount e-commerce websites produce cheap goods, like t-shirts and flip flops, in China and ship them directly to customers, instead of storing them in warehouses in the United States. Promoting through platforms like TikTok, these websites have ballooned in size by quickly identify new fashion trends and enabling teenagers and young adults to try out them out on a limited budget. Besides sidestepping shipping duties, China has also negotiated very low international shipping fees with couriers including the United States Postal Service, which means shipping from China to the United States is often cheaper than shipping domestically, between states. Critics say this has created an unfair playing field for Chinese ultra-budget websites. According to eMarketer, Temu alone will sell $30 billion worth of products in the U.S. in 2025. Companies including Amazon and TikTok are attempting to compete with their own marketplaces for cheap goods. The cancellation of de minimis may not necessarily help them, depending on where the goods originate. President Trump’s new universal tariffs on all imports have been criticized across the political spectrum as a tax on individuals and businesses, and punishing foreign countries based on an incorrect calculus of what they charge the U.S. They are particularly regressive, since lower income consumers have less wiggle room to accommodate higher costs of goods. It is hard to argue that Temu and SHEIN are good services, however. They are selling cheap garbage that does not last. Either you pay $2 for a shirt that has to be replaced after two weeks, or you pay $10 for a shirt that will at least last a few months or longer.   \nAmazonpresident trumpsheinTemu  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          What could go wrong?\n         \n          Bezos' attempt at forming an internet satellite constellation has a lot of catching up to do, but it's finally set to begin.\n         \n          The president said China was \"not happy\" with his tariffs, which are currently decimating the U.S. stock market.\n         \n          Most semiconductor chips used in the United States are imported from Asia.\n         \n          Social media users have noted that there appears to be no logic behind the tariffs.\n         \n          The TikTok ban goes back into effect on April 5.",

    "full_content": "Chloe Veltman\n    \n \n                Prior to the Eaton Fire in January 2025, the Zane Grey Estate was a beloved historical and cultural landmark — the former home of Western novelist Zane Grey.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Pickering Photography/Teresa Fuller, Compass Real Estate\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The former home of one of the world's most famous western novelists, Zane Grey, was a Mediterranean Revival house designed with high, wood-beamed ceilings and airy balconies.  \"It had almost a cathedral vibe when you walked in,\" said Nathaniel Grouille on a recent visit to the site. He bought the property with his wife in 2020. It's been almost two months since the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes in Altadena, including several noted historic and cultural landmarks like this one, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.  During a visit in February, the shattered glass from the estate's windows was still underfoot, along with blackened wood, twisted gutters and broken pieces of ceramic. All that the fire left standing are the sturdy concrete walls.  Gray was known in the 1920s and '30s for his adventure novels set on the American Frontier, like Riders of the Purple Sage and The Lone Star Ranger. Inside, his house reflected his interest in the Old West and Southwest — and those charred concrete walls that remain still bear faint traces of his interests. \"You can see the white stencils made it through the fire, even though the paint itself is gone,\" said Grouille's wife Alice Carr, pointing to a wall painted with Hopi spiritual figures. \n                The Zane Grey Estate in Altadena was almost completely destroyed in the January 2025 Eaton Fire. But unlike other neighboring homes which were largely made of wood, its walls were made of concrete — so they mostly remained intact.\n                \n                    \n                    Chloe Veltman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Grouille and Carr are now facing a big question: How to rebuild the site in a way that preserves Grey's legacy while protecting it from the inevitable future fires and other disasters resulting from the impacts of human-caused climate change? Returning the property to what it was in Zane Grey's day isn't on the couple's agenda. \"This structure was incredibly unique, using really high quality old-growth wood and products that just don't exist today,\" Carr said.  Grouille said they have no interest in using modern materials to build a Zane Grey Estate lookalike — \"A sort of Las Vegas version of a historic house.\" Instead, they'd rather reframe the author's legacy to make sense in an era where human-caused climate change creates increasing threats — perhaps by building new, resilient structures out of sustainable materials that architecturally nod to Grey's personality and passion for the West. \"He mixed sort of a Teddy Roosevelt-type pragmatism with a great romance,\" Grouille said. \"That's the kind of the thing you want to preserve.\" Conservation experts are familiar with this tension.  \"That can sometimes be a delicate balance,\" said Seri Worden, Senior director of preservation programs with the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  Worden said adding a metal roof or removing flammable plantings may increase a historic landmark's chances of surviving a wildfire. But these interventions, if not done carefully, can ruin what makes these places special. \"How can we ensure that we can adapt the historic materials without losing the power these places have?\" Worden said. \n                The Gamble House in Pasadena, a National Historic Landmark, was in a fire evacuation zone in the Los Angeles Fires. Its custodians are now making complex decisions about how to safeguard its future against the impacts of human-caused climate change while at the same time maintaining the historic details and atmosphere for which it is admired.\n                \n                    \n                    Chloe Veltman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n This is a question that historic sites that escaped the flames from the recent fires are also asking themselves — such as The Gamble House. The 1908 property, owned by the City of Pasadena and a National Historic Landmark since 1977, is a crowning example of American Arts and Crafts design — a sprawl of redwood shingles and copper pipes.  It was under an evacuation warning during the recent fires; the team temporarily removed a few key artifacts as a precaution.  \n                The Gamble House is recognized worldwide as a gem of American Arts and Crafts design. Its custodians say if it were to burn down, it would be irreplaceable.\n                \n                    \n                    Alexander Vertikoff/Vertikoff Archives\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n \"We are an enormous wood structure. So fire makes all of us very nervous,\" said Sheryl Scott, the site's director of communications and operations. Scott said The Gamble House staff had previously been focused on earthquake and flood mitigation. Now with the possibility of more fire danger in the future, her team has been making complex decisions.  One was whether to remove the beautiful but potentially hazardous creeping figs clinging to the façade. They decided no. Instead, the plan is to keep the nearby shrubs and trees trimmed.  Another has been figuring out how best to protect the buildings' historic but extremely flammable shingles, also known as shakes. That's a topic of ongoing investigation.  \"We can't replace our shakes with fakes,\" Scott said. \"The integrity of the structure, the historic content, is important to us.\" \n                The Gamble House in Pasadena\n                \n                    \n                    Alexander Verikoff/Vertikoff Archives\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n All of this work takes resources. There are pockets of foundation and donor money. Conservation groups like the Los Angeles Conservancy connect historic landmarks with experts such as architects and contractors willing to provide pro bono or reduced rate assistance.  But Scott said it's a hard time for California landmarks to get grants for protecting or rehabilitating historic sites against disasters. The state's Office of Historic Preservation told NPR it does not offer them. Federal funding sources like the National Park Service are also facing cuts under the Trump Administration. \"Everyone's nervous about the amount of money that's available,\" Scott said. With limited resources, Scott said her team is figuring out what to prioritize in order to keep The Gamble House standing for future generations.  \"The ongoing care and long term survival of the house is always our main priority,\" Scott said. \"Every decision we make is examined through the lens of being responsible stewards.\" Audio and digital story edited by Jennifer Vanasco.

During the final week of February, hundreds of federal workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were firedâabout 10% of the agency workforce. One of the affected employees was Andrew Hazelton, a meteorologist who grew up in Florida and until last month spent his days with the Hurricane Research Division Modeling Team, which helps NOAA understand these extreme storms and mitigate the worst of their impacts. Hazelton is now on administrative leaveâhe’s not allowed to workâa temporary reinstatement position that could keep him (and many other NOAA staffers) in limbo as their situation works through the federal court system. Gizmodo spoke with Hazelton by phone this week to discuss the position that he and hundreds of other federal employees at NOAA are dealing with as the DOGE cuts roll through the federal workforce. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity. Isaac Schultz, Gizmodo:Â  I understand things have changed in the last day with a memo temporarily reinstating staff in “paid, non-duty” status, which potentially adds a new dimension to our conversation. Walk me through the timeline here, from your work at NOAA to the layoffs and basically how far along this rollercoaster we are now. Andrew Hazelton:Â  I’ve been with NOAA in varying capacities for over 8 years. After I got my PhD in 2016, I worked with a postdoc at Princeton University for the NOAA lab up there, NOAA GFDL in Princeton for 2 years, and then I went to AOML, the Hurricane Research Division, in 2018, working for the University of Miami. Last October I started the federal position, working for NOAA’s Environmental Modeling Center doing hurricane models and model development. As of yesterday we areâon paper at leastâreinstated with admin leave, because of the court decision over the weekend. What that looks like exactly, though, there’s still a lot of questions that we’ll have to get answers about. It seems as thoughâ based on the wording of what they sent usâthat they’re waiting for another court to say that they can go through with backpay. And right now we’re not allowed to work. I was a new federal employee even though I’ve worked with NOAA for 8 years or more, and then February 27th we all got that mass email basically just informing us that we were being fired. It was sort of chaotic because they had about an hour’s notice.Â We’ve been in this limbo state. I know some people filed appeals with the merit board. There was this preliminary injunction that allows us to be reinstated, but it seems like it’s going to depend on appeals of that. And there’s still some uncertainty as to whether there could be a legal layoff process after that. Gizmodo: It seems like across a number of agencies, folks are not only being hit with these layoffs, but then being stuck in these situations where it’s very unclear exactly what their status is, and what the federal government’s next move is going to be. Hazelton: Right. It’s depending on court outcomes, and even across departments it seems like certain ones are responding to the rulings differentlyâsome more enthusiastically than others. There are a lot of unknowns. Gizmodo: We could speak about some more unknowns, frankly. Your focus is hurricanes. How many folks who work specifically on the hurricanes have been impacted, at least for the time being, and what this might mean for the publicâpeople who need information about incoming storms? Hazelton: In my group, I was the main person doing hurricanes. There were other people doing other kinds of modeling: severe weather and ocean models, all sorts of things. There were other people in NOAA that were part of the hurricane hunters, the ones that fly into the hurricanes, and I did that as part of my last role. There were a few people from that group that were laid off. A couple dozen may have gotten reinstated as part of the judge’s decision, but there wasn’t much communication about what criteria were used for that, but some were not fully reinstated. They’ve not given a lot of information about criteria or plans, but the big thing is that, if people aren’t fully reinstated, it’s going to be hard. These are people working on some of the computer models that are our main tools collecting data. I know people in the satellite division have been affected, and satellites are one of our big tools for monitoring all sorts of weather, not just hurricanes. Effects could be felt across the board, for anybody who relies on weather data. Gizmodo: Just because our readers are very familiar with hurricanesâmany are in the American Southeastâcan you name a couple of the storms that you flew through? Hazelton: Because I was there through last year, it was the first part of the hurricane season. I was in Helene last year, and then I’ve also flown in storms like Michael in 2018, Dorian in 2019, Ian, which most of the Gulf people remember, Idalia. I’ve flown in quite a few big ones and done work with the aircraft data and also the modeling. Gizmodo: What is it like to fly through a hurricane, and what storm was the most unnerving to go through? Hazelton: Most of the flight is just kind of like a bumpy commercial flight. It’s a P-3 aircraft. It’s a propeller planeâkind of a bumpy, noisy plane in generalâbut very sturdy. But when you get in the eyewallâthat ring near the center that’s the most intense part of the hurricaneâthat’s where you can see some real bumps. I think Michael was probably the storm that was the bumpiest. I wasn’t on the famous Ian flight where they got really rocked aroundâI was the one before that. So Michael and also Helene last year was a pretty intense eyewall. We didn’t want to fly through because it was just so gnarly looking on radar. Gizmodo: People in and affiliated with this administration talk a lot about privatizing weatherÂ forecasting. What are your opinions on that, and what might that outlook mean for federal workers and for the way the public gets their weather information, depending on how successful you imagine that that effort being, should they proceed with it? Hazelton: The thing is there’s already a pretty robust private weather enterprise. There are private companies that do good work. We work with them and a lot of them rely on NOAA data for their apps or different tools. It’s really a pretty good public-private partnership that I think is honestly a model for that kind of thing. I don’t think we want to get to a point where there’s like a subscription-based model for warnings or any sort of life-saving data or information. Honestly, open access to data for the cost of your tax dollars is one of the things that’s really been a model of NOAA. If you look at the numbers, it only costs 6 cents per American per day to fund all of NOAA at its current level. It’s a pretty minuscule cost when you look at like the dollars saved. Whenever there’s a hurricane, better forecasts allow people to get outâor vice versa, if they’re not going to be impacted, they don’t have to close up their school or business. Better forecasts save lives and money. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself. Gizmodo: You mentioned that some folks were reinstated early on. It sounds like it’s kind of a black box as to how those decisions are being made. Is that a fair characterization? Hazelton: Yeah, there hasn’t really been a whole lot of criteria or communication. I think there was supposed to be some veterans’ preference for prior federal service, but it really hasn’t been made clear at all to us how these decisions are being made. Gizmodo: In that case, a silly question that I’ll ask anyway: Is there any idea of how long this ambiguity will last? Hazelton: No, not really. I think it’s going to depend a lot on court cases and how those play out. That’s above my pay grade. I’m just ready to get back to work doing what I love doing and what helps protect the American public. Gizmodo: Given the abruptness of these layoffs and your hands being tied with work, it sounds like you just have some stuff sitting on your desk waiting to be resumed, which with something as dynamic as weather, is probably not the best thing. Hazelton: It’s tough. My coworkers, the ones that are still there, they’re great and they’re working hard, but it’s just hard when you have an agency that’s already understaffed and just being stretched even thinner. It’s hard to get everything done that you want and need to. Gizmodo: Is there anything you really want to get across about either your personal experience right now or the experience of federal workers more generally at this time? Hazelton: Most of us just want to get back to the work we’re doing to help the American public. NOAA’s mission is to protect lives and property. We have a track record of doing that and that’s what we want to get back to doing. \nFederal GovernmentHurricanelayoffsNOAAWeather  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          More than 1,600 respondents reflected the chilling effect across research fields caused by the slashing of federal funding for universities and science agencies.\n         \n          Weather balloon operations will stop or be reduced at 11 locations across the country due to staffing shortages caused by recent NOAA layoffs.\n         \n          The nation's space agency is cutting costs at the behest of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as part of the Trump administration's slashing of science funding.\n         \n          Hurricane Helene, which slammed into Florida's Big Bend in late September, caused the deaths of nearly 250 peopleâa number only dwarfed by the infamous 2005 storm.\n         \n          The hurricane jumped three Safford-Simpson hurricane categories in less than a day, and scientists now propose a new factor that contributed to the storm's evolution.\n         \n          Managers have hit walls trying to rehire former employees due to mysterious and unexplained blocks on their profiles.",

A magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar caused widespread shaking and likely considerable damage because of a lack of buildings built to withstand temblors By Robin George Andrews edited by Andrea Thompson A resident carries belongings over debris next to a damaged building in Naypyidaw on March 28, 2025, after an earthquake in central Myanmar. Sai Aung MAIN/AFP via Getty Images On March 28, at around midday local time, tens of millions of people in Southeast Asia felt the earth below their feet violently rupture. A magnitude 7.7 earthquake, centered just 12 miles away from Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the region—causing streets to buckle, ancient pagodas to crumble, bridges to shatter and houses to collapse. Entire neighborhoods were devastated in a matter of seconds. The earthquake’s energy release was comparable to that of several hundred nuclear weapon explosions. “The magnitude of this event was so high that it was felt in neighboring countries,” says Amilcar Carrera-Cevallos, an earthquake scientist at the Vicente Rocafuerte Secular University of Guayaquil in Ecuador. A 30-story skyscraper under construction in Bangkok—600 miles from the quake’s epicenter—disintegrated. According to estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey, there will be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of casualties, as well as tens of billions of dollars of economic damage. Many factors conspired to make this earthquake a disaster, including a lack of quake-proofing measures in buildings across the region. Few of the structures could withstand this monster of a temblor, which was “a really big, shallow earthquake”—meaning it occurred relatively close to the Earth’s surface, says Judith Hubbard, an earthquake scientist at Cornell University.

Around 45 million years ago, the Indian tectonic plate collided with the Eurasian plate before the former started to descend beneath the latter. The crumbled crust in the middle is what we refer to as the Himalayas today. This mountain range, and the entire region, is filled with faults generated by that epic geological pileup. The Indian plate is still very slowly running into Eurasia, and those myriad faults take on a lot of stress as a result. From time to time, they rupture. The March 28 event was an especially gargantuan rupture along one specific schism. “All available data so far strongly suggest a rupture on the Sagaing Fault,” says Robin Lacassin, an earthquake scientist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. This is a major north-south “strike-slip” fault, one in which two blocks of the crust slide past each other (a bit like the San Andreas Fault in California). The Sagaing Fault is “the main strike-slip boundary on that side of the Indian plate,” Lacassin says. And it “has been responsible for many strong and destructive earthquakes in the past.” Cars pass a damaged road in Naypyidaw on March 28, 2025, after an earthquake in central Myanmar. Sai Aung Main/AFP via Getty Images Hubbard points out that, just in May 2023, the very same fault ruptured and generated a magnitude 5.8 temblor, causing a modest degree of destruction. It’s a particularly perilous fault, not least because Nay Pyi Taw, the capital city of Myanmar, lies directly atop it. Today’s magnitude 7.7 rupture was exponentially more powerful than the 2023 event. Earthquakes are measured on the modified Mercalli intensity scale, which gauges the shaking intensity based on surface observations. Close to the epicenter, nearly a million people felt this quake as IX, or “violent,” on the scale: many buildings weren’t just damaged but also thrown about, with some literally shifted off their foundation. Slightly farther from the epicenter, the shaking ranked as “severe” or “very strong”—and onlookers in Thailand were shocked to see buildings there receive damage as well. Preliminary data suggest that seismic waves traveled so far from the source because they were channeled along the southern section of the Sagaing Fault. “This would explain the damage in Bangkok and reports that it was felt far away,” Carrera-Cevallos says. Earthquakes like this are a horrific reminder of why disasters cannot purely be referred to as “natural.” Today’s quake was powerful, yes—but the cities in the blast zone didn’t stand a chance because of a decidedly human factor. “This earthquake occurred in an area with no earthquake-resistant buildings and inadequate building codes,” Carrera-Cevallos says. Although you cannot design a building to guarantee that it will hold up against the mightiest of earthquakes, you can fit dampeners into their architecture to allow them to safely “sway” in the event of a temblor. Even older structures can be retrofitted to include various forms of quake-resistant technology. The damage in Thailand is shocking but is unlikely to be too severe. The shaking there was less intense than in Myanmar, and the high-rise skyscraper that collapsed in Thailand was under construction, so it is probably an outlier. “We can expect much worse in Myanmar,” Hubbard says. Myanmar’s political situation will work against its recovery efforts. A military coup in 2021 and an ongoing civil war had already displaced millions of people from their homes. This quake is going to dramatically inflate that number, exacerbating an already extensive humanitarian crisis. Strong aftershocks will shake cities, towns and villages for several weeks to come, also impeding the likely chaotic recovery efforts.",

Some noted that no parent earthquake had been felt; they were wondering what had set off the waves. They had no way knowing that the tsunami had been spawned during an earthquake along the coast of northwestern North America. This orphan tsunami would not be linked to its parent earthquake until the middle 1990s, through an extraordinary series of discoveries in both North America and Japan. The Orphan Tsunami of 1700, now in its second edition, tells this scientific detective story through its North American and Japanese clues. The discoveries underpin many of today’s precautions against earthquakes and tsunamis in the Cascadia region of northwestern North America. The Japanese tsunami of March 2011 called attention to those hazards as a mirror image of the transpacific waves of January 1700.

    "full_content": "The Japanese government is releasing rice from its emergency reserve for the first time to address a supermarket shortage and soaring prices. Japan's agriculture ministry held an auction last week in a bid to stabilize the market. It announced on Friday it had selected bidders for almost 142,000 tons of rice from the government reserve, local media reported. Bidders are paying 21,217 yen (about $143) per 60 kilograms and the extra supplies are expected to start reaching stores later this month. Releasing such a large amount of rice would improve the \"supply-demand balance,\" agriculture minister Taku Eto told a press conference.  He said the ministry would carry out another auction later this month.  Rice supplies in Japan started to decline last summer, sending prices sharply higher. Experts have blamed the problem on high temperatures in 2023 damaging crops, and stockpiling over fears of an earthquake — and expectations that prices would keep rising. Despite the intervention, the agriculture ministry said a 5-kilogram bag of rice cost an average of 4,077 yen (about $27) at some 1,000 stores in the week ending March 9. That's almost double the price this time last year and marks the 10th consecutive weekly increase.  Core consumer price index data released by Japan's internal affairs ministry at the end of January showed that the price of rice rose nearly 71% year-on-year in Tokyo's 23 wards. The 231,000 tons of rice authorized to be released from the stockpile represents about 20% of the total, The New York Times reported.",

    "full_content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Twenty years into the smartphone era, you can depend on seeing a natural disaster on video a few seconds after it occurs. If a rainstorm floods a subway tunnel or a fire consumes a residential neighborhood, a real-time documentary is not far behind. On Friday at midday local time, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar. Thousands are feared dead. Even in one of the poorest countries in the world, footage of the event itself was immediately available: monks cowering as a building collapsed down the block, a stupa tipping off a temple building in a shower of red dirt. Hundreds of miles away in Bangkok, a construction worker filmed his colleagues running from a half-finished skyscraper as it collapsed into a cloud of dust. I’m mesmerized by a relatively new entrant into this genre: The sight of rooftop pools sloshing over their parapets, raining water onto the streets below. A handful of skyscrapers in Bangkok spilled over on Friday. Like a lamp swinging from the ceiling, these high-rise waterfalls are a testament to the seismically generated building movement that can be hard to see with the naked eye. Water suddenly appears in places there is not supposed to be water. It’s like seeing a building cry. If you really want a lesson in fluid dynamics, you can watch the videos of the pools themselves. It’s unsettling to see a tall building spill its drink like a drunk at a party. But ultimately, it’s proof of structural achievement: The buildings rock enough to send hundreds of gallons of water overboard, but in spite of their height, they are strong enough to resist the tremors. (It is the age of a building, not its height, that generally puts occupants at risk during an earthquake.) While this phenomenon is not brand new—quake-driven rooftop pool waterfalls have been caught on camera in Manila, Puerto Vallarta, and Taipei in recent years—it’s increasingly frequent. And not just because more people are pointing their phones at the sky. Putting a pool at the top of a building is a relatively recent development in the history of high-rise construction. Water is heavy (don’t fill up an inflatable pool on your roof), and when pools aren’t well-built, the damage can be enormous. There’s a reason landlords don’t want tenants to have fish tanks. According to a report on high-rise pools from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Chicago’s John Hancock Center was the first super-tall building to offer a swim with a view when its 44th-floor pool opened in 1969. But as recently as 2000, most of the world’s super-tall buildings (over 900 feet) did not include pools. That has changed: Since the millennium, most of them do. Some of that reflects the engineering innovations that have allowed giant buildings to proliferate in recent decades. But it’s also a testament to the changing geography of global growth, as skyscraper construction has shifted from North America and Europe to the Gulf and East Asia. Two-thirds of the world’s super-tall buildings have been built in China and the UAE alone, and rooftop pools are obviously a more desirable amenity in warm-weather locales. In Southeast Asia, the skyscrapers with rooftop pools—often flanked by cocktail bars, dance floors, or expensive restaurants—are a societal status symbol. The most famous visual landmark associated with Singapore is probably the Marina Bay Sands, with Moshe Safdie’s oblong, swimmable rooftop straddling three buildings. Most rooftop pools aren’t so easy to spot from below. And that’s part of what makes the videos from Bangkok so revelatory. Disasters pretend to be egalitarian. Ultimately, though, they expose the fissures in society, revealing the disparate experiences between those who have a well-built home, an insurance policy, or somewhere else to go—and those who do not. When water tumbles from a roof, it reveals the power of the earthquake, but also the hidden inequality of the city, provoking the sudden realization, from a lower floor or a hot street below, that those people up there can go for a swim. Meanwhile, in Myanmar, first responders are trying to find people trapped in the wreckage of collapsed structures. The grim reason it takes a long time to confirm an earthquake’s death toll is that many people, if not most, survive the initial collapse. What determines their fate is how quickly someone comes to look for them.",

    "full_content": "A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday afternoon local time near the country’s second-largest city, Mandalay. The quake caused extensive damage across Myanmar and also toppled a skyscraper under construction in Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles away. After the quake, the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions and confirmed more than 100 people killed and many hundreds injured, while Thai officials reported at least seven deaths and scores of people missing. A report from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the death toll will likely exceed 1,000, and could even surpass 10,000 given the quake’s epicenter near populated areas. Myanmar sits atop one of the most tectonically active regions in the world, along a 9,300-mile swathe of land called the Alpide Belt, which extends across the southern region of Eurasia, from the Mediterranean, eastward through Asia, and into the East Indies. The Alpide belt is one of three major earthquake zones on Earth, and is responsible for about 15 percent of all the world’s largest earthquakes, second only to the Ring of Fire in the Pacific. The belt’s tectonic activity has birthed many of the world’s most impressive mountain ranges, including the Alps, the Atlas Mountains, and the Himalayas. Today’s quake today is similar in size and magnitude to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Zhigang Peng, a seismologist at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who has studied quakes along the Alpide in Turkey, says that while Myanmar has experienced large earthquakes in the past, today’s quake—followed by a magnitude 6.7 aftershock roughly 11 minutes later—is among the most powerful to hit the region in recent memory. Since 1900, at least six quakes measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, according to USGS. We spoke with Peng about the region’s seismic history, the causes of today’s quake, and what scientists know about what might be coming. Myanmar is one of the most seismically active areas in the world. Can you tell me about the history of earthquakes in this region? Myanmar is near the southeastern end of the Alpide Belt, and long story short, this area is a well-recognized section of the belt where earthquakes are pretty common. Most of the belt is seismically active, or was in the past. For example, the Alps are part of the system, but most of that area is not tectonically active right now even though it was in the distant past. [Recent research suggests that parts of the southern Alps may still be active.] Of course, earthquakes of such a size as this one are rare, but they have happened. If I remember correctly, the last time a similar-sized event occurred in this region was in 1839, and it was a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. But there have been many “smaller” quakes in the area, including a magnitude 6.8 in 2011. What is driving all this tectonic activity? Is it the same as what is happening in other earthquake-prone places like the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean, the most seismically and volcanically active region in the world? The area has a lot of different things going on. A big part of what is happening is that the African, Arabian, and Indian tectonic plates are moving northward and colliding with the Eurasian tectonic plate. More locally, in Myanmar, the Indian plate is colliding with the Sunda plate, which straddles the equator in the Eastern hemisphere. That’s a subduction zone, where one plate is going underneath another one. But near the edge of this boundary you get what we call a transform or strike-slip fault—one block is moving north, another block is moving south. It’s similar to the San Andreas Fault in the U.S., and actually, this quake today is somewhat similar in size and magnitude to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The Ring of Fire in the Pacific is also a subduction zone, but it’s different in the sense that it’s a lot more volcanically active, and a lot of the earthquakes there are linked to the volcanism in the region. This is a classic example of an earthquake occurring at a place where we know it’s going to happen. How would you describe this particular earthquake? Today’s event is actually very simple. This earthquake was not a part of the mountain-building process, but occurred along a strike-slip fault in Myanmar called the Sagaing Fault. From what I’ve seen, the event is a pretty typical continental strike-slip event. It looks like a fault section of about 200 kilometers broke in a single event near Mandalay, and it mostly propagated to the south. It was pretty shallow, probably around 10 kilometers or so deep, and because the event is so large, it took about one minute to unfold itself and produced some pretty significant shakes. I’ve seen a lot of infrastructure damage, buildings and bridges coming down. [USGS has estimated that the quake ran along a fault section that lies 6 miles (10 kilometers) deep, 124 miles long and 12 miles wide.] Was there any inkling that this particular area was due for an event of this magnitude? Earthquake scientists have studied this region for quite some time, and I would call this a classic example of an earthquake occurring at a place where we know it’s going to happen. Of course, we don’t know when—that’s always the $1 million question—but you can do the math to find out whether or not it’s within an expected range of time, which we call the recurrence interval. If we think of what happened today as a repeat of what happened in 1839, you can see that it has been almost 200 years. And we know that the slip rate—that’s how much stress has been accumulating along the fault—is generally on the order of about 2 centimeters per year. If it’s 2 centimeters per year, and it has been roughly 200 years, you get about 4 meters of accumulated stress. A slip of that size is enough to produce a magnitude 7 event or higher, and that’s what we observed. What are the secondary hazards of such an earthquake? Typically, the three secondary hazards associated with big earthquakes are landslides, fire, and tsunamis. We can rule out tsunamis because it occurred on land, and it also occurred in a region that is relatively flat, so I wouldn’t expect to see major landslides. There are probably going to be small, localized fires that have the potential to get big if they aren’t contained. But most of what I’m looking at are aftershocks. Earthquakes like this one will almost certainly be followed by aftershocks, and some of them could be large. We should expect to see other large events in the next few weeks to months. Most are going to be smaller than today’s earthquake, however, there’s always a chance of a similar size event or, in the worst case scenario, an even larger event.

    "full_content": "The Can Manufacturers Institute highlighted that today there are only three domestic tin mill lines still open in the U.S. With a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel imports taking effect this week, metals-dependent trade groups in the U.S. are calling on the Trump administration for exemptions. Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, said in a statement Wednesday that consumers will feel inflationary impacts from the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  “Recent history has demonstrated that trade protectionist measures have serious impacts for the U.S. economy and domestic food security,\" he said. “Aluminum and steel tariffs place price pressures on American-produced goods by artificially and dramatically increasing the cost of critical production materials, making U.S.-made food less competitive against foreign products.” According to CMI, the domestic can industry produces approximately 135 billion food, beverage, aerosol and general line cans each year and employs more than 28,000 people. Since 2018 tariffs, U.S. tin mill steel producers shut down nine tin mill lines. “Today, only three domestic production lines remain open in the United States, meaning American steel producers cannot meet U.S. demand even with the highest tinplate steel costs in the world,” Budway said. “This opens the door for cheaper canned foods to flood the U.S. market from China and other foreign competitors.” According to the Aluminum Association, the U.S. aluminum industry has invested more than $10 billion since 2016, largely in “mid-and-downstream production and recycling.” “This has been driven by growing demand, a competitive tax environment and strong, targeted trade enforcement the president supported in his first term,” CEO Charles Johnson said in a statement Wednesday. “For this growth to continue, the U.S. aluminum industry needs two things — long-term market certainty and a reliable supply of affordable metal, which today comes in large part from Canada.” Johnson described U.S. industry’s longstanding trade relationship with Canada “a good deal for America” and called for a deal with Canada that secures robust supply. Canada supplies about two-thirds of the primary aluminum used in the U.S., according to the Aluminum Association. In 2023, the U.S. imported 7.71 billion pounds of aluminum from Canada. In a February letter to Trump, CMI, along with American canned food producers and packaging companies such as Silgan, Sonoco, Crown and Trivium, called for exemptions.",

    "full_content": "Wildfires forced a mandatory evacuation in one North Carolina county as emergency crews fought separate fires in an area of the state still recovering from Hurricane Helene, while South Carolina's governor declared an emergency in response to a growing wildfire. The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation starting at 8:20 p.m. Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte. Advertisement Advertisement “Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,” the agency said in a social media post. The public safety department said a shelter had been established in Columbus, North Carolina. The North Carolina Forest Service's online wildfire public viewer indicated three active fires in Polk County, with the two largest spanning between 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) to 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Two other fires were active in nearby Burke and Madison counties, with a third wildfire burning in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as part of an effort to stop a blaze in Pickens County called the Table Rock Fire that started the previous day in an area within the Blue Ridge Mountains. “As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,” McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued Friday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission. Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain, the forestry commission said in a social media post. The Pickens County Sheriff's Office posted an update late Saturday saying crews had ceased operations and would resume Sunday morning with ground personnel and machinery and assistance from helicopters and air tankers. The fire was about 110 acres (45 hectares) and the public was asked to avoid state Highway 11. North Carolina's western region already had been hit hard by Hurricane Helene in September. Among the extensive damage, flooding washed away more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) of eastbound lanes on Interstate 40 leading to eastern Tennessee and remained partially closed to traffic until March. The hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts in North Carolina. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service, meanwhile, has been battling a wildfire that broke out in the Wharton State Forest on Saturday. The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) as of early Sunday morning. Firefighters had contained about half of the blaze according to an 8 a.m. update on the service's Facebook page. Emergency officials said they have evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire but the flames were moving away from them and no structures had been evacuated. The cause of the fire is under investigation.",

    "full_content": "Twenty million trees will be planted and 2,500 hectares (6,178 acres) of new woodland created in the west of England as part of a \"national forest\" drive, the government has announced. The Western Forest will be made up of new and existing woodlands across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, the Cotswolds and the Mendips as well as in urban areas such as Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester. It will be the first of three new national forests promised by the government to help meet a legally-binding target of achieving 16.5% woodland cover in England by 2050. However, with only 10% cover achieved so far, environmental groups have warned much more needs to be done to meet tree-planting targets. The most recent research shows the total area of woodland across the whole of the UK is currently estimated to be 3.28m hectares. That represents 13% of the total land area of the UK but in England just 10% is woodland. Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 hectares of woodland to be planted every year. The latest annual figures show about 21,000 hectares were planted, with the vast majority in Scotland and just 5,500 hectares in England. Andy Egan, head of conservation policy at the Woodland Trust, said there had been \"significant progress\" on tree planting but that there was still \"much more to do\" to meet the UK's targets. He said maintaining government funding was essential. \"Successful tree planting and ongoing management needs long-term grant support,\" he said. \"A tough public spending environment could risk undoing much of the good work.\" Alex Stone, chief executive of the Forest of Avon Trust, which leads the partnership behind the Western Forest project, said there were some areas in the region that currently had only 7% of land covered by trees. \"This is about bringing those areas up so we have trees where we really need them,\" she said. \"What we are aiming to do with the Western Forest is get to 20% of canopy cover by 2050 and, in five priority areas, we are looking at getting above 30%.\" The scheme will particularly target urban areas, including Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester. The government said it would be putting £7.5m of public money into the forest over the next five years. It said the project would not only help the UK's drive to net zero but would also promote economic growth and create jobs in the region. Mary Creagh, minister for nature, said she hoped the Western Forest would also \"make a huge difference\" to water quality, flood resilience and to wildlife as well as bringing nature \"closer to people\" in the region. But she conceded there was much more to do in order to hit England's national tree-planting target. \"I am absolutely confident that we can get to where we need to get to,\" she said. \"Projects like this give me hope and confidence that, with everybody pulling together, working with the public sector and the private sector, we can do it.\" She added that, despite ongoing budget cuts, the next two national forests would be delivered by the end of this parliament, with other sources of funding explored. The Western Forest is the first new national forest to be designated in England in 30 years, following the creation of the original National Forest across Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire, where 9.8m trees have been planted.",

    "full_content": "A pilot has been fined after failing to maintain communication with air traffic control, which led to a flight being intercepted by Britain's Royal Air Force. An investigation by the UK Civil Aviation Authority found that the pilot, Christopher Hollands, didn't appropriately communicate via radio with air traffic control during an SAS Connect flight from Oslo, Norway, to the English city of Manchester in February last year. This is against British law per the Air Navigation Order of 2016. Hollands was sentenced to pay £4,511, or $5,849, on Thursday at Manchester Magistrates' Court. According to the CAA, communication was lost for more than 30 minutes during the flight. This led to air traffic control alerting the RAF over fears that the lack of communication could be a sign of a hijacking. Two Typhoon fighter jets intercepted the Airbus A320 aircraft, which was carrying 58 passengers. When the plane landed in Manchester, it was sent to an isolated part of the airport and boarded by armed police. Glenn Bradley, the head of flight operations at the CAA, said in a statement that incidents of lost communication such as this \"are a matter of great concern both for us as the aviation regulator, and for the Government.\" \"Aviation is one of the safest methods of transportation, and it relies on pilots maintaining radio communication with air traffic control through the standard channels during flight,\" Bradley said. \"We continue to work with pilots, airlines, and the Government to reduce similar incidents, including by prosecuting offenders when appropriate to maintain confidence in UK aviation's safety and security.\" Hollands is the first pilot to ever be prosecuted under this law in the UK. The CAA is now warning other pilots that if an incident of lost communication is deemed serious enough, they could face up to two years imprisonment.",

    "full_content": "The eyes of the world’s news media are trained on Thailand and Myanmar, where a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake has left hundreds feared dead.  \n\tThe United States Geological survey reported that the earthquake struck around four hours ago at a rare magnitude that is described as “major” with the potential for “serious damage.”  \n\tNews networks have since rushed to the scene and pictures and videos being reported by the media have set out the scale of the destruction, as 24/7 news channels quickly pivot their coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOscar Night Earthquake: 3.9 Temblor Rattles North Hollywood Area As Attendees Hit Post-Ceremony Parties\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFestivals\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThai Studio Night Edge Unveils Horror Pic 'Death Dial' Starring Actress Penpak Sirikul & Sanya Kunakorn -- EFM\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tReporting in depth from Myanmar has been difficult since a military junta seized power in 2021 but the BBC is reporting that hundreds are feared dead in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\tDramatic photos of the damage show hotels and large buildings in Mandalay in a crumpled heap, coming as a state of emergency is declared in six regions of Myanmar including Mandalay. The epicenter struck near Manadalay and a video posted on X and verified by the BBC shows a bridge collapsing near to a river. The Red Cross has said that electricity and network lines are down in the area, meaning it’s difficult to assess the full damage.  \n\tIn Thailand’s capital Bangkok, 70 construction workers are reported to be missing at the site of a collapsed building. In a Facebook post, the National Institute for Emergency Medicine in Thailand said around 320 workers were on the site at the time of the collapse and 20 are trapped in the lift shafts. \n\tMeanwhile, videos have been doing the rounds of water cascading from the rooftop pool of an intercontinental hotel in Bangkok, one of which can be seen below.

    "full_content": "At a Congressional hearing earlier this week, Matt Blaze made the point that CALEA, the 1994 law that forces telecoms to make phone calls wiretappable, is outdated in today’s threat environment and should be rethought: In other words, while the legally-mandated CALEA capability requirements have changed little over the last three decades, the infrastructure that must implement and protect it has changed radically. This has greatly expanded the “attack surface” that must be defended to prevent unauthorized wiretaps, especially at scale. The job of the illegal eavesdropper has gotten significantly easier, with many more options and opportunities for them to exploit. Compromising our telecommunications infrastructure is now little different from performing any other kind of computer intrusion or data breach, a well-known and endemic cybersecurity problem. To put it bluntly, something like Salt Typhoon was inevitable, and will likely happen again unless significant changes are made. This is the access that the Chinese threat actor Salt Typhoon used to spy on Americans: The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that a Chinese government hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon broke into three of the largest U.S. internet providers, including AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), and Verizon, to access systems they use for facilitating customer data to law enforcement and governments. The hacks reportedly may have resulted in the “vast collection of internet traffic”; from the telecom and internet giants. CNN and The Washington Post also confirmed the intrusions and that the U.S. government’s investigation is in its early stages. \nTags: CALEA, cybersecurity, eavesdropping, national security policy, telecom  \nPosted on April 8, 2025 at 7:08 AM\t\t\t•\n\t\t\t7 Comments",

    "full_content": "Nintendo’s first post-Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Treehouse livestream is being flooded with angry comments from users calling on the company to \"DROP THE PRICE.\"  A cursory glance at the YouTube chat for the stream shows a flood of complaints about the pricing of Nintendo’s move to the next-generation, which includes the $449.99 Switch 2 and, perhaps most controversially, the jump to $79.99 for Mario Kart World. While the Nintendo Switch 2 system itself will retail for $449.99, a bundle is also available with Mario Kart World included for $499.99, saving $30 on the price of the game. But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $79.99. Some Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also cost $79.99. Nintendo has even come under fire for charging for the Switch 2 tutorial video game experience, Welcome Tour, which fans have said should be a free pack-in. Astro's Playroom, for example, comes pre-installed on every PlayStation 5 console, serving additionally as a free tech demo for the DualSense controller. The shock at Nintendo’s pricing is now spilling over into the Treehouse livestream, although the presenters have so far, perhaps understandably, ignored the chat. It seems likely that Nintendo will face this sort of thing from the video game community from now on, piling the pressure on the company to address the complaints. For more context, be sure to check out IGN’s article revealing what the experts have to say about Nintendo’s Switch 2 and Mario Kart World pricing.
