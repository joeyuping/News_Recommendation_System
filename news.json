With tariffs set to kick in tonight, Razer’s new Blade 16 and other laptops are no longer available to purchase directly. by  Antonio G. Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Razer’s upcoming Blade 16 and other laptops are no longer available for preorder or purchase on its US site. The configurator for preordering its new Blade 16 laptop was available as recently as April 1st, according to the Internet Archive — one day before the Trump administration announced sweeping US tariffs on China, Taiwan, and others that make laptop components. When asked recently if tariffs might affect Razer’s prices or availability, its Public Relations Manager, Andy Johnston, told The Verge, “We do not have a comment at this stage regarding tariffs.” Razer may not be openly talking about the impact of tariffs, but Framework halted sales of its entry-level Laptop 13 in the US on April 7th, and Micron reportedly confirmed surcharges for its memory chips will apply once the tariffs take effect after midnight tonight. The direct link to the Blade 16 configurator now takes you to a 404 error page, and its product page only has a “notify me” button instead of anywhere to submit your preorder. While shopping for other laptops on Razer’s site, only skins and accessories are available for purchase. Even a new laptop stand Razer announced today, which a press release said would be “available now,” only has a “notify me” button with no price listed anywhere. Meanwhile, the same laptop stand has a price of $99.99 CA on the Razer Canada site, where the Blade 16 configurator is still available. It’s a similar story for Razer’s site in other countries as well. We’ve contacted Razer for further comment on tariffs and asked for confirmation that it has paused sales, but it did not respond by the time of publication.

      "full_content": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Thursday that the US intends to take chip manufacturing from Taiwan. Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that while President Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs didn't apply to semiconductors, Trump is still looking at how the US can regain its foothold in chip making. \"Donald Trump's going to deeply study those. And those are going to come later on how to reshore from Taiwan all that semiconductor manufacturing,\" Lutnick said. \"We have to protect ourselves at some point. America has to be able to protect itself.\" Lutnick also questioned why the US's electronics are \"primarily built in Taiwan.\" \"It used to be built here. Our policies let Taiwan take it all,\" Lutnick said. \"We all hold our iPhones, which we love. Why do they have to be made in Taiwan and China? Why can't those be made with robotics in America? And you know what Donald Trump has said? They're going to be made in America,\" he added. On Wednesday, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on all countries with tariffs on US goods. Trump said the tariffs will start at a baseline rate of 10% and affect 185 countries. Taiwan was hit with a reciprocal tariff of 32%. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" Trump said in his announcement. While on the campaign trail, Trump said Taiwan had grown wealthy by taking away the US's chip manufacturing business. Taiwan produces 92% of the world's most advanced microchips, per the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association. \"I mean, how stupid are we? They took all of our chip business. They're immensely wealthy.\" Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview published in July. \"They took almost 100% of our chip industry, I give them credit. That's because stupid people were running the country. We should have never let that happen,\" Trump added. On Thursday, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te wrote in a Facebook post that Trump's reciprocal tariffs were \"unreasonable\" and did not reflect the \"highly complementary and substantive trading relationship between Taiwan and the US.\" Lai said his government will continue to negotiate with the Trump administration. The US has long been trying to reduce its dependence on Taiwan for chip manufacturing. In 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law. The bipartisan bill was meant to bolster US chipmaking by channeling billions of dollars in federal funding to the chip industry. In November, the Biden administration said it had awarded up to $6.6 billion in funding to TSMC to build three chip factories in Phoenix, Arizona. However, experts told Business Insider that while such initiatives would help to bolster chip making in the US, TSMC will probably continue to make its most advanced chips in Taiwan. \"It's very unlikely that the Taiwanese government would allow TSMC to build its most advanced fabs in the US without a few years' lag,\" said Chris Miller, the author of \"Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology.\" \"This is Taiwan's most valuable strategic capability. Without it, extracting a US security guarantee or support from the Trump administration goes from hard to impossible,\" Miller added. Representatives for Lutnick at the Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment from BI.",

      "full_content": "In a world already shaken by economic shocks — from the pandemic to sweeping tariffs — there's one scenario that would dwarf them all: a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. This is the hypothetical the analyst Ben Thompson floats in the latest edition of Stratechery, a newsletter widely followed by tech industry insiders. An invasion wouldn't just be a military conflict; it would be a rupture in the global economic order that underpins everything from iPhones to inflation forecasts. Thompson reckons China would prevail militarily. The larger story isn't about who controls Taipei — it's about what happens when the world's most essential supply chains are shattered. Taiwan isn't just any island. It's home to TSMC, the company responsible for manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors in the world. Take that away, and the modern tech ecosystem buckles — taking with it the digital infrastructure of daily life. This is so important that there's even a theory quietly discussed among global security experts that Taiwan could threaten to destroy its giant chip fabrication facilities to deter China from invading. Thompson argues that regardless of who wins militarily, the economic result is the same: China, the global factory, is effectively cut off. Taiwan's chip output vanishes. Global trade grinds lower. Inflation surges. Markets tank. Recall the 2020 COVID-19 supply chain chaos or last week's market turmoil from Trump's tariff barrage — now magnify that impact exponentially. \"A war over Taiwan,\" Thompson wrote on Monday, \"would put all of these to shame.\" Of course, it's not clear whether, or when, China would invade Taiwan. And even if it did invade, it would face challenges, the defense writer Michael Peck says. But what's particularly striking is Thompson's framing: War might not just break the system — but also be the only way to reset it. The post-World War II economic order, rebooted by Bretton Woods and supercharged by China's entry into global markets, is showing its age. The US traded industrial capability for cheap goods and ballooning deficits. American manufacturing jobs vanished, supply chains lengthened, and the economic resilience of the US heartland hollowed out. (These are the areas where Vice President JD Vance's anti-globalization message really resonates, by the way.) Trump's tariffs — clumsy, politically divisive, and economically painful — might still be preferable to waiting for a war to force change. As Thompson notes, the system can't be fixed without a stomach for hard trade-offs, and America seems unwilling to take the hit until it's forced to. So we return to the Taiwan question — if China invades, or how close we come. The prudent path, Thompson suggests, may be to pull China deeper into economic interdependence, betting that shared prosperity can delay or prevent disaster. But if that gamble fails, the cost won't just be measured in GDP — it'll be in decades of lost stability, broken industries, and a new global order forged not in peace but in fire.",

      "full_content": "The head of the British armed forces has visited China for the first time in a decade. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin discussed \"issues of common concern\" with China's military leaders in Beijing, its defence ministry said in a short statement. \"We agreed that in an unstable world we must play our part as responsible nations with global interests,\" Sir Tony wrote on X, \"and we reflected on the importance of military-to-military communications\". The last time a Chief of the Defence Staff visited China was in 2015. Since becoming prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer has sought to strengthen ties with the country. The admiral's visit coincided with the escalation of an intense trade war between China and the US after President Trump's announcement of higher tariffs. Defence Secretary John Healey confirmed on Thursday that the trip had happened earlier this week. \"It's always good to have military to military engagement and that is what he was establishing\", Healey told reporters in Brussels. He said that the admiral's visit followed in the footsteps of one made recently by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who became only the second foreign secretary to visit China in six years when he went in October last year. Healey said that in the discussions the admiral was \"very firm in the arguments about peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific\" region \"and concerns about any use of military aggression or assertiveness to pursue political ends\".  Healey did not specifically mention Taiwan, where China has launched major military drills which have been seen as provocation towards the island and wider region. Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. Sir Tony has now joined the defence secretary in Brussels for meetings with allies on Ukraine.",

      "full_content": "FORT BRAGG, North Carolina — The low hum of a quadcopter drone cuts through the air like a buzzing bee. It's faint and difficult to track. The sound grows louder as the swarm builds. The drones are fast and small and hard to see, but the noise of the growing swarm is becoming overwhelming. They are rushing over barren dirt roads and empty buildings. Then the bombs begin to fall, and the explosions are deafening. People are hit, collapsing on the ground, screaming, covered in blood as dust fills the air. It's chaos. This shocking opening act was just one element of a training exercise at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where US Army Special Operations Command held its annual Capabilities Exercise, or CAPEX, last week. Open to the public, CAPEX offers a close look at what US Army Special Operations Forces are working on and how they'd respond to a potential real-world conflict. This year's scenario was a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a growing concern as China modernizes its forces. The day began with a briefing from Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, the USASOC commanding general, on the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Braga highlighted 2027, the date Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has indicated China's military needs to be ready to invade Taiwan. While there's no guarantee it takes that step, Braga called it \"by exponential means, the greatest threat we have.\" Thinking about that challenge is playing a role in shaping how ARSOF operators train and the capabilities they develop. American special operators are in a transition period. After decades of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations, they are now shifting, along with the rest of the military, toward great-power competition and potential conflict with a top adversary. Special forces leaders have said the change requires new skillsets from operators that will affect how they approach supporting conventional forces and irregular warfare. In some respects, it will mean a return to Cold War-era roles and tactics. Throughout the CAPEX, ARSOF personnel talked at length about what they're prioritizing. Drones and other uncrewed systems are at the forefront. The initial, simulated drone attack from Chinese forces during the exercise left a few people \"wounded,\" prompting ARSOF to demonstrate their crisis and medical responses. It was tense but orderly — personnel cared for superficial wounds, assessed serious injuries, and took immediate action. The drill shifted into high gear when ARSOF went on offense with a raid into enemy territory aimed at opening up a temporary air corridor for follow-on forces. From the top of a building, BI and others watched as an assault team broke from cover, surprising its enemies with rapid M240B machine gun fire. It was loud and sudden. The American team then took control of the area surrounding a Russian-made SCUD tactical ballistic missile. Enemy uncrewed aerial systems flew around the area, leading to the use of counter-drone capabilities to detect, track, and ultimately neutralize them. Officials said the counter-UAS system used sensors and deployed interceptor drones to conduct a \"command-link takeover\" that essentially breaks the connection between drones and their operators. That system was then used to identify the launch point of the drones. With a loitering munition and a separate drone, the assault team took out the targets. With the air corridor open, forces from the 75th Ranger Regiment and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment were then able to enter the area and target a key enemy facility: a hostile command and control center. Two MH-47 Chinook helicopters, special operations variants of the heavy lift transport aircraft, soared in from the distant tree line. The arrival of the Chinooks was fast. As they came in, they stirred up dirt and dust, making it hard to see two assault squads scurried down ropes, called a fast-rope insertion, from the helicopters onto the tops of adjacent buildings. Just as quickly as they arrived, the helicopters flew off. They couldn't linger. The assault groups cleared the buildings before lining up for an explosive breach of the enemy command building. First-person-view drones were flying around, too, providing critical situational awareness. Once the center's entrance was breached, the groups filed in, neutralizing enemy combatants in close-quarters combat. The combat exercise also included an enemy counterattack. ARSOF fought with Carl Gustaf Recoilless Rifles that fire 84 mm rockets, M240B (7.62) machine guns, M320 grenade launchers, 60mm mortar systems, and Javelin. The counterattack was quickly defeated. And to top it off, ARSOF fired a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to target enemy air defenses and continue to keep the air corridor open, making further infiltration and exfiltration an option. The CAPEX offered visitors a whirlwind look at aspects of a possible fight during a potential Chinese invasion, but it also highlighted other aspects of ARSOF. Its Civil Affairs component, as well as language courses and physical and mental health requirements, were also demonstrated. Col. Luke VanAntwerp, director of US Army Special Operations Command's Capability Development Integration Directorate, called ARSOF \"an incredible bargain\" for the US military. \"With a small investment, a small number of people with generational relationships,\" he said, operators can deter conflict. If it breaks out, though, they want to make sure they can exact a toll on the adversary wherever and however is most effective. USASOC is made up of around 33,000 people. That's less than 6% of the Army, but it's more than 51% of the US military's special operations forces. They're deployed to more than 70 countries, learn 17 different languages, and focus on deterring conflict, making relationships with partners and allies, and keeping their finger on the pulse of what's happening.",

      "full_content": "Google seems to be looking in a different direction for its next set of AI chips. According to a report by The Information, the tech giant could be collaborating with Taiwan's chip maker MediaTek. These chips also known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), would be produced sometime next year, sources close to the project told the publication. It is important to note that Google makes its chips that help train its AI models. However, it relies on Broadcom, an American chip company, to design its TPUs with the help of blueprints provided by Google. This has been the case ever since Google produced its first-gen TPU back in 2015. However, now, after almost a decade of working together, it has decided to broaden its reach. This collab with MediaTek doesn't indicate Google breaking ties with Broadcom but is being frugal about how much it spends on designing its TPUs. As of today, Google TPUs are custom-designed chips used for training large AI models like Gemini and are ideal for training chatbots, code generation, media content generation, and personalization models, among others. It also produces another kind of TPU that deals with \"interference needs\" and powers its existing services like Search and YouTube, The Information added.  The reason it could be making the switch to MediaTek could be because it charges less per chip compared to Broadcom and has a strong relationship with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited), The Information stated. An internal source told the publication that it might be doing things differently with MediaTek; it will handle most of the design of its next TPU, including the processor. \"MediaTek will aim to handle what are known as input/output modules, which manage the communication between the main processors and peripheral components, said one of the two people involved in the project.\" But much like Broadcom, it will handle the chip production process, \"which includes packaging and quality testing,\" another source from Google's TPU team told the Information. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Last year, Google seems to have spent between $6 billion and $9 billion to create one of the most powerful 6th-generation TPUs, according to Reuters. But if it does take the MediaTek route, it could be spending much less and will also give Google an upper hand over other AI companies like ChatGPT and Microsoft, which both rely on American-based chipmakers.

      "full_content": "It's not just a show of force. China's military activities around Taiwan are increasingly realistic combat training, readying it for the real deal. New research on these activities indicates the Chinese military is more active near Taiwan than it has been in the past, with increased daily operations and more frequent patrols and exercises. K. Tristan Tang, a research associate at the Research Project on China's Defense Affairs, writes in a new report that China's military activities in the waters and airspace around Taiwan reached a new high last year. This trend continued in January and February of this year, with activity surging higher. The Chinese activity around Taiwan consistently prompts responses from Tawain's military, such as air defense and shore battery movements, combat air patrols, and more, and those responses offer valuable insight to the Chinese armed forces. In this situation, China's People's Liberation Army is \"using the enemy to train the troops,\" a practice of conducting exercises close to foreign forces for more realistic and applicable outcomes, Tang said. Similar observations have been made about the risky maneuvers around US aircraft by Chinese pilots. The Chinese navy, likewise, has embraced this doctrine with US vessels. Realistic combat training has been a growing priority for the Chinese PLA and has been heavily emphasized in recent years. It allows troops to get a better sense of the actual challenges on the battlefield and understand more about their adversaries. These aren't simple displays of military power, there for show; instead, the activities offer experience needed for combat action. Chinese leader Xi Jinping emphasized the need for realistic combat training in 2018, instructing the military to \"to strengthen real combat training and improve its war-winning capability,\" according to state media. The emphasis could be seen in PLA's recent large-scale joint exercises surrounding Taiwan, namely the two \"Joint Sword\" drills that occurred last year. Joint Sword-2024 A occurred in May, while Joint Sword-2024 B took place in October. Both involved elements of the PLA conducting demonstrations around Taiwan. May's came on the heels of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's inauguration and October's after Taiwanese Independence Day. The drills sent a message to Taiwan and its international partners, but there was more to it than that. Two developments seen in 2025 so far indicate the PLA Navy specifically is enhancing its realistic combat training, per Tang. The first is that PLA Navy activities around Taiwan have seen an overall increase. Numbers from Taiwan's Ministry of Defense indicate a rise in the number of PLAN vessels operating near Taiwan compared to previous years, 419 in the first two months of this year compared to 305 in 2024 and 218 in 2023. Similarly, the number of joint combat readiness patrols involving assets from multiple military branches, such as PLAN vessels and PLA Air Force planes, are higher as well. And the number of PLAN ships involved in these patrols is up, too. Another notable development was the large deployment of a Type 75 landing helicopter dock amphibious assault ship task force near Taiwan last month, which was early in the annual training cycle and the largest publicly disclosed LHD task force ever near Taiwan, Tang said. It's not initially clear whether these efforts are intended to put pressure on Taiwan or if increasing readiness ahead of China's 2027 goals is the priority. US officials have said China plans to be ready to take Taiwan — by force, if necessary — by that year. That is an observed readiness goal, not necessarily an assault date. China considers Taiwan as part of its territory. Xi has made reunification with the island nation a priority. China has broad military modernization goals for 2027, the 100th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army. It also has goals for 2035 and 2049, the latter of which is 100 years after the founding of the People's Republic of China. By then, China intends to possess a \"world-class military\" that can fight and win wars. Increasing its military presence around Taiwan to gain more realistic training falls in line with \"accelerating efforts to meet\" the 2027 agenda items, Tang said, \"regardless of whether an actual invasion of Taiwan occurs.\" Documents related to Taiwan's defense drills that were reviewed by Bloomberg identified 2027 as a possible invasion date. The Han Kuang Exercise, Taiwan's largest live-fire defense drill, will also double in length to 10 days in total this summer. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm these details. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US didn't immediately respond to BI's questions on the date or its impact on the annual exercise.",

      "full_content": "Seeking adventure and needing to pay off student loans, I moved to Taiwan in my early 20s. I was complaining about my debt when a friend mentioned that teaching English abroad could be a good way out. My job as a child and youth worker in Canada was not covering the bills. I convinced my then-boyfriend to join and we spent the next two and half years teaching kindergarten and elementary students in Taiwan But after fiscal success, having achieved our goal, we decided to move back to Canada. Returning home in my mid-20s with an inflated ego after a few years of easy money, a comfortable life, and a level of respect as an English teacher proved to be a hindrance to my success in Canada. We lost a lot of our savings in the time it took us to set up our lives again. We struggled to find jobs in Canada that paid enough to meet living expenses and ended up moving four times between cities. We found ourselves once again in a financial hole that was becoming deeper with every passing year. So, 6 years later, after getting married, we returned to Taiwan in 2009, this time, our plan was to relocate permanently. I spent most of my 30s, the next 7 and a half years, in Taiwan teaching English. I loved the job, the lifestyle, having financial security, the opportunity to travel, designing my dream apartment, and eventually, adopting three cats. However, even though we were building a good life in Taiwan, it didn't negate the fact that a significant part of our life was back in Canada, our family. While living in Taiwan, my father-in-law died suddenly of a heart attack, and our world tilted. We went home to mourn with my husband's family but realized two weeks was an insignificant amount of time to process such a loss. Just over a year later my nephew passed away on his school playground at recess. He was 8 years old and I had spent 7 years in Taiwan. I had met him only a few times in his short life. Suddenly, the money, the pretty apartment, and the beautiful view no longer held us captive.  My husband and I starkly began to understand that the distance between us and our family meant that we could not really be a part of each other's lives. We could not be there to grieve, celebrate, or share. We've now been back in Ontario, Canada for almost 8 years. I'm involved in my nieces and nephews' lives and I take time to travel with my sisters. My five brothers are no longer strangers to me. I've been able to visit my only living grandparent many times since I've been back — she's in her mid-90s. I see family almost every month now for holidays or sometimes just to get together. At 46, after starting over in Canada again, changing careers, and dealing with the rising cost of living, I doubt that we'll ever be financially comfortable again. We'll probably never own a house, buy a new car, go on fancy vacations, or have a comfortable retirement. But it's all worth it to watch my nieces and nephews grow into adults. I also have time for intimate conversations with my siblings during car rides or while hiking nearby. I found grand adventures out there — lessons and insights that came when I stripped away everything familiar and influential. Growth happened when I pushed beyond my boundaries and realized the only limits were the ones I had created.  I also came to see the tremendous value in sometimes staying put.",

      "full_content": "A quiet Japanese island has found itself on the front lines of the tense dispute over Taiwan. Growing tensions between China and Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims is part of its territory, has transformed Japan's once quaint ecotourism destination into a military fortress. Yonaguni, Japan's westernmost island, is located just shy of 100 miles from the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, making it a strategic frontline outpost for Japan and allies like the US. In a reminder of the island's new status, a cattle ranch has become a military base, and authorities are expanding the port to accommodate larger warships. \"As a child, I was so proud of this westernmost border island,\" Fumie Kano, an innkeeper on Yonaguni, told the Associated Press. \"But recently, we are repeatedly told this place is dangerous, and I feel so sad.\" While the influx of troops has boosted the island's security and economy, residents are forced to brace themselves against a possible conflict mere miles away. Located over 300 miles from Okinawa's main island, Yonaguni Island is considered the most remote of all the Okinawan islands. The island has an area of about 11 square miles — roughly the same size as Disney World's Magic Kingdom theme park. Only a third of the island is inhabited by three villages — Sonai, Kubura, and Higawa — with the remaining area being covered by farmland and vegetation. Fishing, agriculture, and tourism are the main sources of livelihood for the island's tiny population of about 1,500 people. The island was once home to 12,000 people in the late 1940s, but has shrunk to less than 2,000 people in recent years. Yonaguni is known for its picturesque landscapes and rare animal species, including three-foot-tall ponies that can only be found on the island. The Atlas moth, considered the world's largest moth with a wingspan of nearly 10 inches, is also native to the island. As Japan's westernmost inhabited island, it is the last place in Japan to see the setting sun. In 2021, the island also inspired Bad Bunny's chart-topping reggaeton song, Yonaguni, in which the Puerto Rican rapper sings in both Spanish and Japanese. The island is also known for mysterious underwater ruins stretching over 300 feet near its southern coast, known as the Yonaguni Monument. Whether the monument was manmade or naturally formed is still under debate, with scientists estimating that the megalith could have been created long before humans had the means to create such a structure. Divers have spotted hammerhead sharks and, on rare occasions, a whale shark, the largest fish in the world. Yonaguni lies less than 70 miles from the east coast of Taiwan between the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea. As China's military presence continues to grow in the region, Japan has strengthened its military presence, particularly on its southwestern islands, such as Ishigaki, Miyako, and Yonaguni. A cattle ranch on Yonaguni has been transformed into a military base, and Japanese forces plan to expand an airport and port on the island's south coast to accommodate large ships. The Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force has deployed US-made PAC-3 interceptor missile units and Japanese surface-to-air missile systems to the southwestern islands. Tom Shugart, former US Navy submariner and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the missile systems could be useful in a conflict scenario over Taiwan. \"If Japan is involved in helping to defend Taiwan, which it has said it might, then that system might be useful,\" Shugart told Newsweek. \"Not so much for protecting any large-scale infrastructure on Yonaguni — because I don't think there is any — but it might be useful for protecting offensive systems that could be used against China.\" Despite residents voting to bring Japanese military forces and assets to the island, some locals remain apprehensive about the rapid militarization of the island. \"Even those who voted in favour of the base are scared about missiles being based here,\" Toshio Sakimoto, a local councillor, told The Guardian. \"I worry whenever something is happening in Taiwan, such as an election or Chinese military drills.\" To quell islanders' fears about what would happen in an actual emergency, officials released a plan last detailing the evacuation of 120,000 residents on remote islands in just under a week. Yonaguni Mayor Kenichi Itokazu proposed building a basement shelter and expanding its port to support evacuation efforts by sea, though skepticism still surrounds the contingency efforts. \"It's absurd,\" Kano, the Yonaguni innkeeper, told AP of the evacuation plan. \"I just hope the money will be spent on policies that will help the people in Yonaguni live peacefully.\" Not only has the landscape of Yonaguni changed in recent years, but the population is also experiencing a shift. Following a 2015 referendum, hundreds of Japanese troops have been deployed to Yonaguni, including a coast watch unit and an electronic warfare unit. The local economy has improved and, in turn, grown largely dependent on Japanese military personnel and their families which now make up a fifth of the island's population, sparking concerns for local civilians. \"Everything is pushed through in the name of the Taiwan emergency,\" Kyoko Yamaguchi, a local potter, told the AP, \"and many feel this is too much.\" Public data forecasts that the troop population and their dependents could make up over 31% of the island's tiny 1,500-member population, The Guardian reported, with the potential to rise to almost 40% the following year. Tetsu Inomata, a café owner who lived in Yonaguni for 20 years, told The Guardian that he believes the Japanese armed forces could overtake the island's civilian population in the next few years. Residents of the island have seen firsthand China's increasing military presence in the region. In 2022, China fired several ballistic missiles into Japan's southwestern waters, one of which landed just 50 miles from Yonaguni island near 20 fishing boats, though no injuries or damage was reported in the incident. \"It was an extremely dangerous exercise that really made us feel China's potential threat right next to us,\" Shigenori Takenishi, chief of Yonaguni's fisheries association, told the AP. In August, the US Marine Corps deployed radar to Camp Yonaguni after Chinese Y-9 electronic intelligence aircraft and two drones presumed to belong to China passed near the island during surveillance missions of Taiwan. The next month, Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning transited through waters between Yonaguni and Iriomote Islands, which drew concern from the West. The percentage of Chinese warships passing through the Yonaguni Channel has increased since 2020 from 0 to over 26% as of 2024, according to Japan's defense ministry. The US and Japan have also conducted military drills in the region, in part to project power against China. Stressed by ongoing military activity, locals criticized the drills as disrupting the island's serenity. The militarization of the once-tranquil island has left residents divided on whether the buildup has been beneficial or detrimental. Supporters say Japanese military personnel have been crucial for the island's safety and a much-needed boost to its struggling local economy. Prior to hosting Japanese troops, Yonaguni officials had planned to form economic relations through commercial exchanges with Taiwan via direct ferries between the islands. Critics have accused the US and Japan of exploiting the island simply for the sake of military posturing against China, with little to no regard for its impact on its residents and the environment. \"I think the plan has been to have long-range missiles here that are capable of reaching the coast of China,\" Inomata, the café owner, told The Guardian. \"We're being used by the Americans, and Japanese leaders like Fumio Kishida and Shinzō Abe have been willing participants. For them, everything is about defense.\" Shoko Komine, a local restaurant owner, told The Guardian that there's a chance Yonaguni could get \"dragged into\" a conflict over Taiwan, which would drive people away from visiting the island. \"I don't think there is going to be a conflict any time soon, but even the risk of something happening will stop tourists from coming,\" Komine said. \"The town government should put more effort into promoting tourism, but at the moment it is obsessed with defense.\" Yonaguni residents fear the military build-up could tarnish the island's reputation as a peaceful island known for its untamed wildlife and beauty. \"Being at the center of this issue is very stressful for residents,\" local shopkeeper Takako Ueno told the AP. \"I don't want people to imagine this beautiful island turning into a battlefield.\"",

Along with the latest equipment — much of it from the United States, the military is seeking funds to retain more service people with higher pay and to lengthen compulsory national service from four months to one year. In a speech Thursday to the American Chamber of Commerce, Lai said his administration is determined to \"ensure that our defense budget exceeds 3% of the GDP. At the same time, we will continue to reform national defense.\" Lai's comments were the latest reassurance to U.S. and domestic critics who say Taiwan is not spending enough on its own defense. The self-governing island, which relies on the U.S. for much of its cutting-edge weaponry, currently spends about 2.45% of its gross domestic product on its military. U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that Taiwan increase defense spending as high as 10% of GDP, a proportion well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend, in order to deter China. China's actions have also unsettled neighbors in the South China Sea and other parts of the Indo-Pacific. Leaders in Australia and New Zealand have said China should have given them more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live fire exercises in the seas between the two countries last month, forcing flights to divert on short notice. Lai said that Taiwan plans to \"advance our cooperation with the U.S. and other democracies in upholding regional stability and prosperity.\" China considers the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its own territory and has significantly boosted its military to make good on its threat to invade the island to assert its control. Raymond Greene, the de-facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan; Dan Silver, the chamber chairperson; and Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy attended the speech. Taiwan and the U.S. have no formal diplomatic ties but American law requires Washington respond to threats toward the island.",

The new restrictions announced by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) are the latest attempt to block foreign access to cutting-edge American chips, despite prior objections from Nvidia and semiconductor industry groups. More than 50 of the new entities added to the list are based in China, with others located in Iran, Taiwan, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. BIS says the restrictions have been applied to entities that acted “contrary to US national security and foreign policy,” and are intended to hinder China’s ability to develop high-performance computing capabilities, quantum technologies, advanced artificial intelligence, and hypersonic weapons. “American technology should never be used against the American people,” said Jeffrey Kessler, Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security. “BIS is sending a clear, resounding message that the Trump administration will work tirelessly to safeguard our national security by preventing U.S. technologies and goods from being misused for high performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs that threaten our national security.” Six of the newly blacklisted entities are subsidiaries of Inspur Group — China’s leading cloud computing service provider and a major customer for US chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel — which BIS alleges had contributed to projects developing supercomputers for the Chinese military. The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence is another addition to the list, which has criticized its inclusion. “We are shocked that a private non-profit scientific research institution has been added to the entity list,” the research institute said in a statement to the Associated Press. “We strongly oppose this wrong decision without any factual basis and ask the relevant US departments to withdraw it.” China’s Foreign Ministry has also condemned the export controls, saying the blacklist expansion “seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations.” The updated export restrictions come amid already heated tensions between the US and China, with President Trump having imposed sweeping new tariffs against goods coming from the country since taking office.

The Register reports:  One of those companies is apparently called Yunhe Zhiwang (Shanghai) Technology Co., Ltd and develops high-end network chips. The Bureau claims its chips are used in China's \"Data East, Compute West\" strategy that, as we reported when it was announced in 2022, calls for five million racks full of kit to be moved from China's big cities in the east to new datacenters located near renewable energy sources in country's west. Datacenters in China's east will be used for latency-sensitive applications, while heavy lifting takes place in the west. Staff from Intel and Microsoft were apparently lured to work for Yunhe Zhiwang, which disguised its true ownership by working through a Singaporean company.\n \nThe Investigation Bureau also alleged that China's largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), used a Samoan company to establish a presence in Taiwan and then hired local talent. That's a concerning scenario as SMIC is on the USA's \"entity list\" of organizations felt to represent a national security risk. The US gets tetchy when its friends and allies work with companies on the entity list.\n \nA third Chinese entity, Shenzhen Tongrui Microelectronics Technology, disguised itself so well Taiwan's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology lauded it as an important innovator and growth company. As a result of the Bureau's work, prosecutors' offices in seven Taiwanese cities are now looking into 11 Chinese companies thought to have hidden their ties to Beijing.",

      "full_content": "The party started as so many do — with pancakes in a parking lot. I attended Nvidia's GTC conference, which has taken over downtown San Jose, California, this week. Tuesday was the biggest day for the AI juggernaut. At 10 a.m. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began his keynote address, which lasted more than two and a half hours. It was a chilly early morning in San Jose. The \"pregame\" started at 6:30 a.m. with breakfast from Denny's, the restaurant where Huang came up with the idea for Nvidia. I needed to know who would show up more than three hours early for a speech about computer chips. When I arrived just before 7 a.m., the line was already substantial. A massive red mobile Denny's kitchen was cooking up \"Nvidia bytes\" — essentially sausages and pancakes. Diners were encouraged to wrap up their bytes like a taco and add syrup on top, like Huang does. I chatted with some of the early birds. Some were die-hard Nvidia fans. Some were jet-lagged, having flown in the day before from London or Toronto, so they were up anyway. Some wanted to get into the SAP Center as soon as the stadium doors opened to avoid the massive lines that would form the hour before the speech. Some heard a rumor that Huang himself might stop by the tailgate. And sure enough, by 7:25 a.m., muscled men in suits with earpieces started multiplying. With no fanfare, Huang walked out from behind the registration tent wearing his signature uniform, all black and a leather moto jacket. The bleary-eyed crowds sprung into action — phones up for photos. Huang donned an apron and went inside the food truck to make some pancakes, as he had as a 15-year-old Denny's employee. \"At this pace, I'd run the company out of business. I used to be a lot faster,\" he said of his chef skills after emerging from the kitchen and immediately meeting CNBC reporter Kristina Partsinevelos and a camera crew. Partsinevelos tried to ground the conversation, but Huang was all jokes. \"You're talking about the stock? I'm talking about Denny's!\" he said. By 8:15 a.m., Huang disappeared into the SAP Center, where he turned up on the pre-show panel airing live inside the stadium. As I reached my floor seat, the panel was giving a reverent retrospective of the company — including its many brushes with failure before AI changed everything. Leading up to the speech, Nvidia's partner companies were eager to find out if they would garner a mention on one of tech's brightest stages. One Nvidia employee told me that up to the last minute, a local war room of Nvidia employees was tweaking the company's dozens of announcements. Once the speech starts, it was all in Huang's hands. He kicked off by firing T-shirts into the crowd from an Nvidia-green T-shirt cannon. \"I just want you to know that I'm up here without a net. There are no scripts, there's no teleprompter, and I've got a lot of things to cover. So let's get started,\" Huang said. The 62-year-old CEO proceeded to blow through his scheduled two hours. He focused on Nvidia's advancements, a flurry of new partnerships and software tools for AI developers, and coming chip architectures that could underpin the computation speed and efficiency that creates new industries. These are already creating what Huang calls \"AI Factories.\" He also spoke on the challenges of realizing the AI-enabled future he has promised for years. He addressed shortages of fresh data to feed AI models, limitations in the ever-important training phase, and energy constraints. The world of computing has reached a \"tipping point,\" and the \"platform shift\" to accelerated computing is well underway, he said. The crowd stayed rapt, although a little antsy at the two-hour mark. But the final video clip reenergized the room. A Disney-designed robot named Blue, which looked like part of the Star Wars universe, toddled through a desert and then ascended — for real — from below the stage. Then the crowd jumped to their feet and raised their phones. \"Have a great GTC! Thank you! Hey, Blue, let's go home. Good job,\" said Jensen. After the speech, thousands of attendees streamed into the downtown San Jose streets. The SAP Center, which had only a few empty seats, holds 17,500, and 25,000 people were expected at this year's event. The crowds made their way back to Plaza de Cesar Chavez, temporarily renamed GTC Park, to find lunch at the procession of food trucks on-site daily. Attendees again had to wait in long lines. The lunch lines were just one of many signs that GTC has outgrown its traditional home. Lines to get into the San Jose Convention Center's conference sessions snaked through the hallways. Nvidia still calls GTC a developer conference, though the evolution from technical developer confab to serious dealmaking destination was on display at a swanky building next to the convention center dedicated only to business meetings. The elevators couldn't handle the volume of people constantly coming in and out. Even Nvidia team members arriving just behind me balked and abandoned ship to relocate when they saw the lines. Getting from the sidewalk to the meeting room inside the building took 35 minutes. \"The only way to hold more people at GTC is we're going to have to grow San Jose, and we're working on it,\" said Huang during the keynote. Logistics aside, I soon met with Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of healthcare, who detailed the many ways Nvidia's accelerated computing is changing how doctors and hospitals work. She said it could be decades before robots can actually perform surgeries without human assistance. But companies like Moon Surgical are already creating surgical assistance robots to hold cameras and tools with arms that never tire. Nvidia also works with da Vinci robots, which can suture wounds, among other tasks. I then headed back to the convention center to walk the exhibition floor during happy hour, where I saw some of the technology Powell championed on display. Because Nvidia's impact spans many industries, the floor showcased cars, vacuuming robots, simulated human bodies ready for surgery, and all the biggest names in cloud computing. I also passed the Nvidia gear store, which was booming. A worker there told me the 2025 GTC T-shirt and puffer vests were the biggest sellers. My 12-hour Tuesday at the conference ended at the GTC Night Market back in the park. The setup was an homage to Huang's love of Taiwan's night markets, with live music, drinks, local food like bao buns, yakitori, cupcakes, and a punnily-named \"juice\" bar sponsored by GPU cloud provider Coreweave. If Nvidia has its way, AI is going to continue to do a lot of hard work for us going forward. But 12 hour-days are here to stay, at least for a while. On my way back to my hotel — via San Jose bike share past a now-silent SAP Center — I thought of these two I had spotted inside the convention center: Have a tip?

      "full_content": "A Taiwanese shipbuilding firm has debuted a new uncrewed surface vessel that it said was inspired by Ukraine's attacks on Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Named the Endeavor Manta, the 28-foot-long sea drone is meant to fire light torpedoes and ram into targets with explosives on its bow, the Taiwan International Shipbuilding Corporation, or CSBC, said on Tuesday. The drone's debut comes as Taiwan has pushed hard into designing, purchasing, and building more uncrewed vehicles to potentially counter any aggression from China. Should Beijing seek to take the self-governed island by force, the effort would likely require sending troops on a perilous amphibious assault across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait. CSBC said the Endeavor Manta was built with versatility in mind: It's designed to be launched at any port or beach in Taiwan and can be carried on the back of a commercial truck. The firm touted the Endeavor Manta as an all-purpose platform that can be used as a port inspector, loitering munition, drone jammer, mine-hunter, recon vehicle, decoy, short-range air defense, or even a mothership for smaller drones. \"In severe weather or maritime accidents, it assists with firefighting, search and rescue, and emergency supply transportation,\" the firm added, publishing a concept image of the drone spitting water on a burning ship. Per CSBC, the Endeavor Manta can be controlled using 4G, satellite, and radio signals, and can return autonomously to its launch point or self-destruct if it's jammed or hijacked. The Endeavor Manta has a fiber-reinforced plastic hull and displaces about five tons of water, so it's a relatively small naval craft. By comparison, Taiwan's Anping-class patrol boats displace about 600 tons, while its Cheng-Kung-class light frigates displace around 3,200 tons. CSBC said its new drone can also reach a top speed of 35 knots, or roughly 40 miles per hour. Given the vessel's size, it's highly likely any torpedo would have to be fitted externally. Images of the Endeavor Manta on display at Kaohsiung's Singda Port show that several of its sensors and cameras are mounted on a raised platform above the drone's hull. While CSBC said the drone was \"influenced by the Ukraine-Russia War,\" the Taiwan Strait's waters can be choppier than in the Black Sea. To give the Endeavor Manta more stability, it designed the drone with a trimaran hull. Based on footage released by CSBC of the Endeavor Manta, the drone appears to have a cabin and steering controls for a pilot if needed. CSBC's chairman, Huang Zhenghong, told local TV that the drone is built with a \"red-free\" supply chain, meaning it contains no components from mainland China. The Endeavor Manta joins a growing Taiwanese arsenal of sea and aerial drones aimed at frustrating a Chinese amphibious invasion. Ukraine's own successes against Russia's Black Sea Fleet, which it crippled through sea drone attacks and long-range strikes, have been a stark demonstration of how uncrewed vehicles can be effective against a traditional navy that's stronger on paper. Over a third of the fleet has been destroyed since 2022. Taipei and Washington have been closely watching the Black Sea battle. Adm. Samuel Paparo, who leads the US Indo-Pacific Command, said in June that he wanted to turn the Taiwan Strait into an \"unmanned hellscape\" that could buy Taiwan a month for the US to respond to any Chinese aggression. That same month, Taiwanese media reported that local shipbuilding company Jong Shyn was using a 20-ton uncrewed vessel as a test platform for building exploding sea drones and other tools. Tensions between China and Taiwan have continued to worsen as Beijing says it won't rule out annexing the island by force and repeatedly conducts military exercises threatening Taipei. Meanwhile, Taiwan's people in 2024 once again elected leaders from the Democratic Progressive Party, which has staunchly campaigned against resisting China.",

      "full_content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — The Chinese military conducted large-scale drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan on Tuesday that included an aircraft carrier battle group, as it again warned the self-ruled democracy against seeking formal independence. The exercises involved navy, air ground and rocket forces and were meant to be a “severe warning and forceful containment against Taiwan independence,” according to Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command. No operational name for the drills was announced nor previous notice given. Advertisement Advertisement China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, while most Taiwanese favor their de facto independence and democratic status. Any conflict could bring in the U.S., which maintains alliances in the region and is legally bound to treat threats to Taiwan as a matter of “grave concern.” Read More: What to Know About U.S.-Taiwan Relations Under Trump Taiwan’s Presidential Office posted on X that “China’s blatant military provocations not only threaten peace in the #Taiwan Strait but also undermine security in the entire region, as evidenced by drills near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines & the SCS. We strongly condemn China’s escalatory behavior.” The SCS refers to the South China Sea, the strategic and disputed waterway that China claims almost in its entirety. China’s navy also recently held drills near Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no warning, forcing the last-minute rerouting of commercial flights. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said it had tracked 19 Chinese navy vessels around the island in a 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday. It added that the Shandong aircraft carrier group had entered into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, a self-defined area tracked by the military. Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of these exercises. Taiwanese officials have recently warned that China could launch a sneak attack under the guise of military exercises. Read More: China’s ‘Punishment’ Military Drills Concern Even Taiwan’s Beijing-Friendly Party “I want to say these actions amply reflect (China’s) destruction of regional peace and stability,” said Taiwan’s Defense Minister Wellington Koo. Taiwan has set up a central response group to monitor the latest exercises, Koo said. On the streets of Taipei, people said the atmosphere was tense but they were more concerned about the economy and developments surrounding the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. “The Chinese Communists spend so much time and effort on these things but most people don’t pay much attention,” said Lin Hui-tsung, a noodle seller in the Tiananmu district. China’s Xinhua News Agency said the Eastern Theater Command conducted “multi-subject drills in waters to the north, south and east of Taiwan Island.” The theater command “organized its vessel and aircraft formations, in coordination with conventional missile troops and long-range rocket launching systems, to conduct drills of air interception, assault on maritime targets, strikes on ground objects, and joint blockade and control,” Xinhua quoted the command as saying. The exercises were “aimed at testing the troops’ capabilities of carrying out integrated operations, seizure of operational control and multi-directional precision strikes, the command said. “The PLA organized naval and air forces to practice subjects such as sea and land strikes, focusing on testing the troops’ ability to carry out precision strikes on some key targets of the Taiwan authorities from multiple directions,” said Zhang Chi, a professor at China’s National Defense University in an interview with Chinese state television. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said the exercises were directed at Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s strongly pro-independence president. “Lai Ching-te stubbornly insists on a ‘Taiwan independence’ stance, brazenly labeling the mainland as a ‘foreign hostile force,’ and has put forward a so-called ‘17-point strategy’ … stirring up anti-China sentiments,” China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement. “We will not tolerate or condone this in any way and must resolutely counter and severely punish these actions.” Read More: Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te Is Standing His Ground In mid-March, Taiwan’s Lai put forward a 17-point strategy aimed at shoring up Taiwan’s security. The points include allowing espionage cases to be tried by military courts and making immigration rules stricter for Chinese citizens applying for permanent residency. China’s PLA also released a series of videos to publicize their military exercise, including one in which they depict Lai as a green parasite “poisoning” the island by hatching smaller parasites. The video shows Lai’s head on the body of a bulbous green worm, with a pair of chopsticks picking him up and roasting him over a flame set over Taiwan. The U.S. said China’s actions were only worsening tensions. “Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk. In the face of China’s intimidation tactics and destabilizing behavior, the United States’ enduring commitment to our allies and partners, including Taiwan, continues,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. “The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo, including through force or coercion.” Taiwan and China split amid civil war 76 years ago, but tensions have risen since 2016, when China cut off almost all contacts with Taipei. In the Philippines, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. asked Filipino forces to prepare to rescue Filipinos working and living in Taiwan if China invades the island, speaking during a ceremony marking the founding anniversary of the military command that secures the Philippine region closest to Taiwan. “If something happens to Taiwan, inevitably we will be involved. There are 250,000 overseas Filipino workers in Taiwan and we will have to rescue them,” Brawner said. —Wu reported from Bangkok.

      "full_content": "Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain may have been for naught with the Trump administration's new tariffs that target multiple countries where Apple sources components for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Apple has worked to move some of its manufacturing to countries like India, Vietnam, and Thailand, all of which are facing steep tariffs in addition to China and Taiwan. There is a minimum 10 percent tariff for all U.S. trading partners, and \"reciprocal tariffs\" on several countries where Apple suppliers are located. Some of the tariffs: As The New York Times notes, Apple is already contending with a 20 percent tariff in China, which is set to increase significantly. Taiwan, where Apple sources the Apple silicon chips that go into all of its devices, is facing a 32 percent tariff. The last time Trump was in office, Apple was able to get tariff exemptions or avoid tariffs entirely for some products, but Trump claims that he will not provide exemptions this time around. Morgan Stanley estimates that devices imported from China will cost Apple an additional $8.5 billion annually without exemptions, though it is not clear if Apple would pass those costs to consumers with price increases. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that the United States is not able to compete with China and other countries when it comes to manufacturing due to a lack of skilled workers with expertise in advanced tooling. Apple stock is down 7.5 percent in after hours trading after the tariff announcements. The tariffs will go into effect on April 9, according to Trump.

The EOS R50 V launches in April 2025 for $649.99 alongside the $849.99 Canon PowerShot V1 announced last month. by  Andrew Liszewski If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Canon has announced an updated version of its EOS R50 with improved video capabilities, a smaller body, and a cheaper price tag — thanks in part to losing an electronic viewfinder. The original, which launched in 2023, was an entry-level mirrorless camera with 4K video capabilities that maxed out at 30fps. The new EOS R50 V bumps that to 4K at 60fps and borrows some features from the video-focused PowerShot V1 point-and-shoot Canon announced in February. The Canon EOS R50 V will be available sometime in April at $649.99 (the original debuted at $680) for the camera body alone. It will also be sold in an $849.99 bundle that includes Canon’s new RF-S14-30mm F4-6.3 lens featuring optical image stabilization and powered zoom capabilities controlled by a ring instead of a button or a lever. Canon says the use of a ring makes it easier to smoothly control the lens’s zoom, whether using the camera in portrait or landscape modes or while shooting selfie videos. The camera features the same 24.2-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor as the original EOS R50 and uses Canon’s Dual Pixel AF II system with focus breathing compensation that can also be found on the EOS R6 Mark II and the PowerShot V1. New video recording modes include options for slow or fast shutters depending on the type of action being captured. There’s also a video mode with electronic stabilization to smooth out footage captured while the camera is moving, but there’s still no in-body image stabilization. Where the EOS R50 V differs from its predecessor is a complete lack of a built-in flash and no electronic viewfinder. Framing shots is all done either on an external screen or using the three-inch articulated touchscreen on the back of the camera. The EOS R50 V is also much easier to use in either vertical or landscape modes thanks to a redesigned grip, an additional tripod screw mount on the side of the camera, and a second video record button on the front. Four different livestreaming modes are supported, accessible through a dedicated button, including HDMI and support for Canon’s Camera Connect and Switcher Mobile apps. Although the EOS R50 V may seem like an affordable cinema camera solution for filmmakers, its somewhat limited capabilities make it better suited for video content creators looking for an upgrade to the PowerShot V1 that will let them swap lenses. Alongside today’s EOS R50 V news, Canon has also announced global availability for the PowerShot V1. The point-and-shoot was initially announced in February 2025 with a late April launch for a limited number of countries including Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Canon says that same shipping timeline will now include the US, with the camera priced at $899.99.

      "full_content": "Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Sen. John Fetterman on Wednesday. And Bibi’s gift to the senator from Pennsylvania is likely to raise more than a few eyebrows. Fetterman was presented with a silver-plated pager, apparently in reference to the terror attack orchestrated by Israel that targeted thousands of Hezbollah members in Lebanon late last year using pagers rigged with explosives. “This is a silver-plated beeper. The real beeper is like one-tenth the weight. But it changes history,” Netanyahu told Fetterman. Fetterman’s response to Netanyahu while holding the ghoulish memento was one of tremendous thanks. “When that story broke, I was like, ‘Oh, I love it. I love it.’ And now it’s like, thank you for this,” Fetterman said. Israel’s terror attack killed at least 42 people, including an 8-year-old and an 11-year-old, and injured about 3,250 more, including 200 critically. Israel built the pagers themselves in a major operation, producing the devices through a manufacturer in Taiwan and selling them to Hezbollah without any indication they were behind the deal. The attack was denounced by experts at the UN as a violation of international law. âThese attacks violate the human right to life, absent any indication that the victims posed an imminent lethal threat to anyone else at the time,â the group of experts said in a statement at the time. âSuch attacks require prompt, independent investigation to establish the truth and enable accountability for the crime of murder.” Netanyahu gave President Donald Trump two similar commemorative pagers back in February, one gold and another described as “normal.” Elon Musk, the billionaire oligarch currently destroying the U.S. federal government, appeared to be pictured near one of the pagers in the Oval Office shortly after it was given to Trump. Defenders of Israel’s attacks tried to justify the tactic by suggesting that everyone who was killed or injured deserved it. But experts pointed out that such a large-scale attack against thousands of devices without knowing who was actually holding the devices was a terrible violation of international laws. âTo the extent that international humanitarian law applies, at the time of the attacks there was no way of knowing who possessed each device and who was nearby,â the UN experts said. âSimultaneous attacks by thousands of devices would inevitably violate humanitarian law, by failing to verify each target, and distinguish between protected civilians and those who could potentially be attacked for taking a direct part in hostilities.” âSuch attacks could constitute war crimes of murder, attacking civilians, and launching indiscriminate attacks, in addition to violating the right to life,” the experts concluded. \nBenjamin NetanyahuGazaGaza WarHezbollahJohn FettermanLebanon  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem says people shouldn't try to \"hide behind the First Amendment.\"\n         \n          Trumpâs comments about turning Gaza into a resort have inspired hellish AI videos and memecoins.\n         \n          The tech giant is facing pushback from employees following a report that it's making a lot of money helping Israel decide where to drop bombs in Gaza.\n         \n          Musk admitted X is throttling links but this is a new level of weird.\n         \n          It took years, three different shell companies, and an explosive called pentaerythritol tetranitrate, according to reports.\n         \n          Beirut said that the new explosions have killed 9 and injured 300.",

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs are here, and they could mean increased prices on a variety of goods Americans rely on. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order announcing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, set to go into effect on Saturday, as well as a reciprocal-tariff strategy. The announcement sent global markets plummeting. Trump said countries would be charged \"approximately half\" of what they have been charging the US. (Tariffs are taxes that US importers pay, not ones individual countries pay.) The tariffs apply to nations with which the US has the highest trade deficits and take effect next week on Wednesday. The reciprocal tariff on goods from China is 34%. That's on top of the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods, meaning the total effective tariff rate on Chinese goods now stands at 54%. The announcement sets a 49% tariff for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, and 44% for Sri Lanka. The reciprocal goods tariff is 32% for Taiwan and 26% for India. The European Union has been hit with a 20% tariff. Trump also announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US. He did not mention any new tariffs on Canada or Mexico during his remarks. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" Trump said. He said of his motivation for the reciprocal tariffs: \"They do it to us, and we do it to them — very simple. Can't get any simpler than that.\" In the weeks leading up to Wednesday, Trump signaled various tariffs he was planning to implement. They included a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, a 25% tariff on all car and car part imports into the US, tariffs on agricultural goods, and reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have placed tariffs on US goods. A 25% levy on steel and aluminum imports is already in effect. These tariffs are likely to increase the prices of affected goods. While some companies might choose to absorb some of the costs, consumers are set to shoulder most of the burden. Markets and consumers have already been feeling financial strains due to the uncertainty with Trump's trade plans. The US is likely to face retaliatory tariffs following Trump's announcement. The leaders of multiple countries, including Canada and China, vowed they would be taking countermeasures but did not immediately provide details. In a video address on Thursday, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that tariffs \"make things work worse, not better,\" and that the EU was ready to take \"firm countermeasures if necessary.\" She added: \"Our immediate response to tariffs is unity and determination.\" The United Auto Workers union previously praised the president's plan to place a 25% tariff on all cars and car parts imported into the US, saying it would bring more jobs back into the US auto industry. \"These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country,\" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. Correction: April 3, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the reciprocal tariff rate on China. It is 34%, not 32%.",

      "full_content": "Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap. Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap. by  Tina Nguyen and  Kylie Robison AI companies can’t figure out if the Trump tariffs are about to decimate them – and the fact that no one has a clear answer is sending them, and the tech industry overall, into a confusion spiral.  The markets are in disarray. Nvidia is down 7.59%, TSMC is down 7.22%. In San Francisco, sources tell us that this isn’t a big deal. But in DC, people are panicking. The core question is whether GPUs – the graphics processing units that are crucial to AI computing and other industries – are exempted from Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and the answer is startlingly ambiguous.  Inside AI labs, researchers expect that their industry will be granted a tariff exemption. “I fully expect this to be a situation where Trump again gives companies he views as important/on his side/whatever a hall pass,” similar to what the President did with Apple during his first term, one source inside a major AI lab told The Verge.  In Washington, however, nobody seems sure what the current state of play is. The Trump administration spelled out an exception for the semiconductor chips at the heart of a GPU, but for now, complete electronic products that contain chips will apparently be subject to tariffs. And companies that need GPUs for machine learning, deep learning, real-time processing, and much more require not just the chip, but the entire machine built around it. “Most AI GPUs are, I believe, imported not as chips but as servers, largely from Taiwan,” Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, told The Verge in an email. “So these would presumably face the general Taiwan tariff rate” of 32%, currently scheduled to hit on April 9th. Ordinarily, government agencies might be able to explain what’s happening. But when asked for clarity, a public affairs official at NIST, the agency at the Commerce Department overseeing the CHIPS Act – a $50 billion investment in building chip manufacturing plants on American soil – directed The Verge to the White House. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did the U.S. Trade Representative, the agency responsible for creating and executing the President’s tariff strategy.  While the SF crowd is bullish on getting exemptions, tech lobbyists in Washington are closer to the chaos that is the second Trump administration, and are far too familiar with the president’s mercurial whims and vindictive nature, particularly against the tech industry. The fact that the tariffs are so vague and seem haphazardly thrown together – so haphazard, in fact, that there’s a legitimate argument that they were generated by AI – is only adding to their worries. “Everyone’s asking for clarity” from the administration, one lobbyist at a major tech company told The Verge. “So far, folks are saying that they think we’re okay, but not sure yet.” That’s not exactly a ringing vote of confidence for GPU tariff exemptions.  The GPU confusion is rippling beyond the AI industry, hitting the Big Tech companies that stock thousands of these devices in datacenters across the country. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all rely on access to GPUs to prop up their multi-billion dollar cloud architectures. Clearly, the market isn’t confident that their bottom line will weather these tariffs: The so-called “Magnificent Seven”, which includes the three companies above, have lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since the tariffs were announced. (Spokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment for this story.)  The AI industry has reason to think Trump might favor it in particular. Just a few months ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and other tech CEOs stood in the White House alongside the president to announce Stargate, a $500 billion datacenter infrastructure project devoted to fulfilling Altman’s demands for “more compute.” The current unclear state of GPUs coupled with the unpredictability of Trump’s tariffs in general, however, could shake their confidence — or at least mean they must renew attempts to curry Trump’s favor. “If the tariffs are unchanged, we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.” GPU juggernaut Nvidia has apparently begun moving manufacturing to the US, which it hopes will help insulate it from the tariffs. Reuters reported last December, for instance, that it was finalizing plans to produce its Blackwell AI GPU chip at TSMC’s Arizona plant, which aims to start fabricating chips this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang alluded to this partnership in a recent investor Q&A: “We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around. Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.”  The same can’t be said for compute-hungry AI labs, hyperscale cloud providers, or even average PC builders — all of whom might end up paying substantially more for GPUs. “None of this is impossible, but trying to produce every segment of electronics supply chains domestically will produce a staggering increase in cost, especially in the short-term, given that some of the capabilities simply don’t exist domestically,” Miller said. That doesn’t even take into account the tariffs on the raw materials needed to build these machines and plants, or any retaliatory measures: on Friday, for instance, China announced a new set of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for electronics manufacturing. The U.S. currently imports 90 percent of its rare earth minerals from China. “If the tariffs are unchanged,” Miller added, “we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.” But ultimately, fealty to Trump might be more crucial than an appeal to reason. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged allegiance to the new administration, which is important for Anthropic, since it sources some of its compute through Amazon. These deals are fragile, though. A single critical story in Bezos’ paper The Washington Post could lose Amazon (and by association, Anthropic) a tariff exemption, for instance. Anthropic also sources some of its compute through Google; along with Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai joined the gaggle of tech billionaires behind Trump at his inauguration. And there are other factors that could indirectly cause problems for these companies, of course — like the US being pushed into a recession that devastates the tech economy. “The second order effects of the tariffs could still be bad,” the AI lab source added. The market tumbles seemed to have mobilized tech leaders. A group of tech CEOs and finance leaders are on their way to Trump’s private resort, Mar-a-Lago, according to journalist Kara Swisher. The goal seems to be to find some sense in these tariffs — and perhaps some exemptions.

      "full_content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s President William Lai Ching-te said that a Taiwanese semiconductor company's massive investment in Arizona is the “best model” for the island's effort to build computer chips supply lines that don't rely on Chinese producers, in remarks to the state’s visiting Governor Katie Hobbs. Taiwan’s leading chipmaker TSMC has committed $100 billion to build three chip foundries, an R&D center and two packaging facilities in Arizona, on top of a previous pledge to build $65 billion in three chip foundries in the state, one of which has begun operations. Lai and TSMC say that the latest mega-investment stemmed from customer demand and not pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump. Trump previously said that Taiwan had taken away the U.S. chip business and that he wanted it back. At their Tuesday meeting, Lai said Taiwan and Arizona were working to build a “non-red” supply chain that excluded suppliers from China, which threatens military action to assert its claim over the island. TSMC has said the development plans in the U.S. would not affect its work in Taiwan, and that the company currently has 10,000 employees researching and developing 1.0 nanometer chips. Taiwan accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production. The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider. News about the meeting was released Wednesday by Taiwan's official Central News Agency. The project is expected to create 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years and tens of thousands of tech and manufacturing jobs, Hobbs’ office said in a news release sent before the meeting. “I’m thrilled by Arizona’s emergence as America’s hub for advanced manufacturing, creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs and bringing billions of dollars of investment into our state,” Hobbs said in the release. CNA quoted Hobbs as saying that the TSMC project would “not only contribute to the global advancement of artificial intelligence and other technologies, but also strengthen bilateral ties.”",

      "full_content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China has lashed out at accusations it is endangering maritime safety made by top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies in a joint statement, saying the G7 members are “filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions.” Even for China's generally overheated diplomatic language, the statement issued Saturday was unusually vitriolic, although it did not threaten any retaliation. In the Friday statement that sparked the Chinese response, the G7 said, “We condemn China’s illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions that seek unilaterally to alter the status quo in such a way as to risk undermining the stability of regions, including through land reclaimations, and building of outposts, as well as their use for military purpose.” “We reaffirm that our basic policies on Taiwan remain unchanged and emphasize the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity,” the statement said, referring to the crucial waterway separating China from the self-governing island republic it claims as its own territory. In the response issued through its embassy in Canada, where the two-day G7 meeting was held in La Malbaie, Quebec, China said the statement “repeated the same old rhetoric, ignored facts and China’s solemn position, grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs, and blatantly smeared China.” “The statements are filled with arrogance, prejudice and malicious intentions to suppress and attack China. China strongly deplores and opposes this and has lodged solemn representations with the Canadian side,” the statement said. China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, through which passes around $5 trillion in global trade. It has dismissed and occasionally clashed with other countries that claim parts of the sea, especially the Philippines, a U.S. treaty partner. China is not a member of the G7 but closely follows all comments and references to its international status made by international organizations or in foreign countries, responding to criticism with caustic language. China has firmly rejected a U.N.-affiliated court's ruling that invalidated most of its claims to the South China Sea and says its claim to Taiwan is non-negotiable, even if China has to use force against the island. China routinely sends ships and warplanes into airspace and waters near Taiwan, built military bases on human-made islands in the South China Sea and recently staged surprise live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand for which it gave no advance notice. Australia's aviation authority said it learned of the drills just 30 minutes before they began, not from Beijing but from a pilot flying in the area, and 49 commercial flights were forced to alter their flight paths in response. The G7 did not mention the drills in its statement. “We share a growing concern at recent, unjustifiable efforts to restrict such freedom and to expand jurisdiction through use of force and other forms of coercion, including across the Taiwan Strait, and in the South China Sea, the Red Sea, and the Black Sea,” the G7 said. China has the world's largest navy, including three aircraft carriers, with a fourth on the way. It has a base in Sheikhdom of Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and consistently has expanded the range of the force.",

      "full_content": "The laptop maker Framework is pausing US sales of some of its lower-end models, citing President Donald Trump's tariffs. Framework, a San Francisco-based company known for its modular and upgradable laptops, announced Tuesday that certain base systems in its Laptop 13 series would be removed from its US site and their sales temporarily halted. \"Due to the new tariffs that came into effect on April 5th, we're temporarily pausing US sales on a few base Framework Laptop 13 systems (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U),\" the company said on X. \"For now, these models will be removed from our US site. We will continue to provide updates as we have them.\" In response to a user asking for more information, the company cited the 32% reciprocal tariff that Trump levied against Taiwan. \"We priced our laptops when tariffs on imports from Taiwan were 0%,\" the company said. \"At a 10% tariff, we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss. Other consumer goods makers have performed the same calculations and taken the same actions, though most have not been open about it.\" Framework isn't the first company to hit the pause button on some of its US sales while evaluating the ramifications of Trump's tariff blitz. Nintendo, which manufactures largely in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, has pushed back US preorders of its highly anticipated Switch 2 to an undetermined date (though it says the game console will still launch on June 5). The British automaker Jaguar Land Rover has stopped shipping its cars to the States, citing a new 25% tariff on automobiles. A Framework spokesperson told Business Insider that no other information was available and that the company would provide updates as it received them. Framework brands itself around making electronics that are inherently customizable and repairable — it's on a mission to improve consumer electronics, which it describes as \"broken.\" \"Our philosophy is that by making well-considered design tradeoffs and trusting customers and repair shops with the access and information they need, we can make fantastic devices that are still easy to repair,\" its site says. Its Laptop 16, for instance, allows for plenty of user fiddling — the keyboard, ports, and discrete graphics processing unit can all be swapped out, depending on a customer's preference.",

      "full_content": "seUnited Airlines has been approved to begin operating flights with onboard Starlink satellite internet service. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the airline a certificate to operate the service on its fleet of Embraer 175 aircraft, with United expecting to install the SpaceX service on all 300 of the regional jets by the end of the year. Starlink will be a free service for UnitedPlus members, which is essentially all passengers as the loyalty program is free to join. United and Starlink announced last year that the airline would outfit its entire fleet of more than 1,000 aircraft with Starlink in the next few years. SpaceX has been on something of a tear recently, signing deals with numerous partners to offer Starlink beyond rural households, including partnering with T-Mobile and cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean. Beyond United, it has also signed deals to offer in-flight WiFi with Hawaiian and private jet operator JSX. The service is not expected to work well in densely populated areas as high-speed fiber is already available, and a singular Starlink satellite would likely not have enough bandwidth to serve many users simultaneously. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said Starlink would likely never be suitable in urban environments where high-speed internet access is already plentiful. Starlink is expected to reach more than $11 billion in revenue in 2025, buoyed by government and commercial contracts. It helps essentially subsidize the cost of SpaceX rocket launches, as the company can send up new Starlink satellites with each payload. Airlines are eager to offer the service as existing offerings from the likes of Gogo have been notoriously slow and unreliable, resulting in frequent complaints on social media from customers who pay $10-20 for a WiFi pass only to find the service does not work. Starlink can offer broadband-like speeds thanks to its constellation of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO), though latency is high due to the inherent nature of sending requests to space and back. It is somewhat surprising that airlines are willing to eat the cost of providing Starlink service considering the business model of “unbundling” airline tickets and charging extra for each perk. It would be unsurprising to see airlines eventually throttle the service and upcharge for faster speeds. Being associated with Elon Musk, Starlink comes with some baggage. Where the service has been able to supply crucial internet access in locations such as Ukraine, countries in Asia and Europe have expressed some reservations about relying on internet service controlled by a close confidant of President Trump. Europe is developing its own Eutelsat alternative, while Taiwan has similarly been exploring other options out of concern regarding Musk’s ties to China for Tesla sales. In Canada, the province of Ontario recently canceled a $100 million Starlink contract in retaliation over U.S. tariffs. Musk may be able to secure lucrative government contracts domesticallyâand the Treasury Secretary has pushed to use Starlink in the government’s rural internet access programâbut his newfound influence is a double-edged sword. Musk’s empire is exposed to geopolitical conflict being so close to President Trump. \nElon MuskSPACEXstarlinksUnited Airlines  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The destruction of the Trump regime will be felt for generations.\n         \n          Good luck getting your grandparents on X.\n         \n          Tesla's factory in Shanghai only produces the carmaker's more affordable models, with the Model S and X imported from the U.S.\n         \n          A senior official describes the billionaire as an awkward and obnoxious asshole.\n         \n          Once again, the Trump admin is pulling back from a dumbass move.\n         \n          An audit of DOGEâs handling of data at federal agencies is reportedly underway.",

      "full_content": "Apple's custom silicon chips will begin to be manufactured in the United States at an accelerated pace as TSMC adjusts its timelines, although the chips produced domestically will be limited to older models for the foreseeable future, Nikkei Asia reports. Exclusive Apple chip supplier TSMC has confirmed that future fabrication facilities in the United States will be brought online more quickly than its first Arizona-based plant, which was beset by delays. TSMC now expects new U.S. plants to take no more than two years to complete, a significant improvement over the five-year timeline required for its initial facility. Despite the expedited pace, the chips produced in these new plants will not power Apple's latest models, as the most advanced fabrication processes will remain exclusive to TSMC's operations in Taiwan. The company's first U.S. plant, located in Phoenix, Arizona, began construction in 2020 and is expected to begin production in 2025. This facility is configured to produce chips using TSMC's N4 process, which is part of the broader 5-nanometer node family. This generation includes the A16 Bionic chip, originally introduced in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Pro and later used in the iPhone 15, ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, and the latest entry-level iPad. The S9 chip used in the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is also an N4 chip. These chips are no longer at the top of Apple's product line technologically and their production today simply supports continued manufacturing of the company's older or lower-end models. TSMC has announced plans for a second Arizona plant that will support production of 3-nanometer chips, currently the most advanced node in mass production and used for chips like the A17 Pro, M3, A18, and M4. However, this second facility will not begin operations until 2028, at which point Apple's mainstream devices will likely have moved to 2-nanometer or more advanced silicon. A third facility, expected to produce chips with the 2-nanometer process, is planned for completion before the end of the decade, though TSMC has not committed to a specific timeline beyond \"before 2030.\" Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the first 2nm Apple chip to be the \"A20,\" debuting in the ‌iPhone‌ 18 lineup next year, again suggesting that the U.S. chips will lag well behind the technological requirements of future high-end Apple devices. The disparity between US and Taiwanese chip production timelines is partially a result of TSMC's longstanding technical and organizational infrastructure in Taiwan, where all research and development continues to take place. The company's semiconductor dominance is also considered by some analysts to act as a \"silicon shield,\" deterring potential military aggression from China by making Taiwan's stability a matter of international economic importance.

      "full_content": "On 2 April US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs, arguing that they would allow the United States to economically flourish. These new import taxes, which Trump imposed via executive order, have sent shockwaves through global markets as they kicked in this week. But the US president believes they are necessary to address trading imbalances and to protect American jobs and manufacturing.  Here are the basic elements of the plan. A baseline tariff of 10% on almost all foreign imports to the US kicked in on 5 April. Some countries and goods are exempt, which we'll explain later. The companies which bring the foreign goods into America will have to pay this tax to the US government, although this could have knock-on effects to consumers. Some countries will only face the base rate. These include: White House officials also said that they would impose what they describe as specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the \"worst offenders\". These have come into effect on 9 April.  Trump's officials say these countries charge higher tariffs on US goods, impose \"non-tariff\" barriers to US trade or have otherwise acted in ways they feel undermine American economic goals. Here is a list of key trading partners subject to these customised tariff rates (these figures include the baseline tariff): China is facing the heaviest tariffs, after a 104% levy on Chinese goods imported into the US came into effect on 9 April. China, in turn, has said it will hike its tariff on US goods from 34% to 84%, starting on 10 April.  Separately, Trump has ordered that low-value goods entering the US from Hong Kong and mainland China will be subject to import duties from 1 May onwards. The \"de minimis\" exemption has allowed foreign products costing $800 (£624) or less to enter the US duty-free - but that will no longer apply to Chinese imports. Canada and Mexico, which were targeted in Trump's previous round of tariffs, face no additional levies. The 10% baseline rate does not apply to them. The White House said it would deal with both countries using a framework set out in Trump's previous executive orders, which imposed tariffs on both countries as part of the administration's efforts to address the entry of fentanyl to the US and border issues. Trump previously set those tariffs at 25% on all goods entering from both countries, before announcing some exemptions and delays. While the new round of tariffs applied globally covers most foreign goods entering the US, there are some exemptions. According to the White House's fact sheet, these include copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, bullion, energy and \"other certain materials that are not available in the United States\". Articles subject to a US Code clause, widely interpreted as \"informational materials\", communications and donations, are also exempted. The tariff rates also do not apply to steel, aluminium, vehicles and vehicle parts - but that's because they are subject to separate 25% tariffs on specific sectors.",

      "full_content": "The Denisovans were a mysterious group of archaic humans who likely lived from around 370,000 years ago to at least 30,000 years ago, and are believed to be an offshoot or sister group of the Neanderthals. What little we know about Denisovans is based on a handful of fragmented fossil remains unearthed in Siberia’s Denisova Cave and China’s Tibetan Plateau. A new analysis, however, adds another piece to the Denisovan puzzle. In a study published today in the journal Science, a team of researchers from Japan, Taiwan, and Denmark revealed that a jawbone previously discovered in Taiwan belonged to a male Denisovan. They reached this conclusion after conducting a paleoproteomic analysisâan analysis of ancient proteinsâwhich revealed two protein variants associated with Denisovans. The identification provides the most compelling evidence yet that Denisovans lived across different habitats and adapted to diverse climates. “The high-quality palaeoproteomic data obtained from Penghu 1 [the fossilized jaw], enabled by relatively good fossil preservation and optimized protein extraction methods, indicates that Penghu 1 belonged to a male Denisovan,” the researchers wrote in the study. Fishers dredged up Penghu 1, along with other animal fossils, from the seabed of Taiwan’s Penghu Channelâan area that was part of the Asian mainland during the lower sea levels of the Pleistocene Epoch (2.5 million to 11,700 years ago). According to the study, the jawbone dates to either 10,000 to 70,000 years ago, or 130,000 to 190,000 years ago. The reason for two sets of fairly divergent age ranges has to do with the methods used to date the fossil. Because of the jawbone’s degradation, the team couldnât use direct dating techniques like uranium-series or radiocarbon dating. Instead, the scientists relied on indirect clues, such as the fossilâs chemical composition, the types of animal fossils found nearby, and historical sea-level data. Altogether, this evidence pointed to the two possible time windows. The researchers, sequencing proteins extracted from the jawbone and teeth, recovered 4,241 amino acid residues (the building blocks of protein) and identified two of them as Denisovan-specific variantsâmeaning the jawbone belonged to a Denisovan. This direct molecular evidence of Denisovan presence in modern-day Taiwan supports a theory previously indicated by genetic studies of modern humans: namely, that Denisovans existed in southeastern Asia. One of the few things we know about Denisovans is that they interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans. As such, some people today have genes passed down from distant Denisovan ancestorsâparticularly people from southeastern Asia, suggesting that Denisovans lived and interbred with modern humans there. Before the jawbone’s paleoproteomic analysis, however, Denisovan fossils had only ever been molecularly confirmed from northern Asia. “The identification of Penghu 1 as a Denisovan mandible confirms the inference from modern human genomic studies that Denisovans were widely distributed in eastern Asia,” the researchers explained in the study. What’s more, the “presence of Denisovans in diverse geographical and climatic zones,” ranging from the cold winters of the north, to the high-altitude chill of alpine subarctic zones, to the warm and humid conditions of the tropical lowlands, “demonstrates their adaptational flexibility.” The researchers also conducted morphological analyses on the jawbone, concluding that the Denisovan man had a robust jaw, large molars, and notable root structures. Significantly, these characteristics align with Denisovan fossils from the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting they may represent broader Denisovan traits. Ultimately, the study sheds light on an ancient human relative we still know little about, while expanding our understanding of early human development across southeastern Asia. \ndenisovansGeneticsPaleontology  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          New analysis shows several families of dinosaurs were likely thriving in North America in the latter days of the dinosaur era.\n         \n          Colossal Biosciences' feat of genetic engineering has people talking, but not every scientist is on board with its claim of having brought back the dire wolf.\n         \n          23andMe is potentially selling more than just your genetic dataâthe personal survey info it collected is just as much a privacy problem.\n         \n          About one in five Americans has a genetic risk for a dangerous type of cholesterol.\n         \n          Scientists have debated where Prototaxites belong in the tree of life for over a century, but now a new study suggests it might represent a whole new branch.\n         \n          There's only so much you can learn from a consumer DNA test, and most people simply don't need one.",

      "full_content": "World War Fee US President Donald Trump has imposed a base ten percent tariff on imports into America, and higher levies on goods from major producers of digital tech, such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan. At an event he named “Liberation Day” Wednesday, Trump declared a national emergency on the grounds that the practices of America’s trading partners “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.” The sole example of technology industry practices cited in the Trump administration’s fact sheet and executive order is India charging a ten percent duty on imported American switches and routers, while the USA charges no duty on such networking devices entering its land. The ten percent blanket tariff comes into force on April 5. Four days later, the US will impose “reciprocal tariffs” – levies in response to other countries’ import duties – on many nations. These retaliatory fees, outlined in a list published on the White House’s X account, target several countries known to host significant tech manufacturing industries. Among major hardware-producing nations, Thailand and Malaysia will be hit with the highest reciprocal tariffs - 36 percent - ahead of China at an additional 34 percent and Taiwan at 32 percent. Imports from China are already tariffed at 20 percent and that won't go away. Reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports mean they will cost 26 percent more once they reach the USA, a blow to its ambition to become a global tech manufacturing player. Another aspiring tech player, Vietnam, faces 46 percent reciprocal tariffs. Taiwanese imports will cost 25 percent more by the time they reach US buyers under the reciprocal tariff plan, as will kit from South Korea. Japan and Thailand each face 24 percent reciprocal tariffs. Even Israel, one of the USA’s staunchest allies, will face a 17 percent reciprocal tariff. Everything imported from the European Union will be subject to a 20 percent tariff. One apparent goal of these levies is to encourage manufacturers to make more gear in America so as to avoid these import fees. What's made in the USA will thus be more competitively priced than shipped-in tariff-hit foreign components and products, so buying American costs less in the nation all while lowering revenues for overseas suppliers. Hence why Apple and others have pledged to invest in factories in the United States. It's hard to imagine these tariffs won't, at least in the short-to-mid-term, result in price rises for folks and businesses in America, however, because importers pay the tariffs and will likely protect their profits by passing on the increased costs to buyers in the States. Manufacturers need time to either shift production to stateside factories or build new facilities, all of which involves cost. The alternative is that businesses bringing products into the US take a hit to their profit margins by absorbing the tariffs. If you are in the US, prepare to pay more for foreign-built parts and stuff for now, we reckon. Intel, Apple, and Samsung manufacture in Vietnam. Many hard disk drives are made in Thailand. Dell makes laptops in Malaysia. iPhones are now made in India as well as China. In some good news for Taiwan, a powerhouse of manufacturing thanks to the likes of TSMC, the White House signaled that semiconductors will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs. However, President Trump has previously warned of 100 percent tariffs on imported chips. Copper, pharmaceuticals, lumber, steel and aluminum, some minerals, certain automotive parts, and other bits and pieces, are also spared from reciprocal tariffs. Additionally, Canada and Mexico are exempted from the 10 percent base rate as they are already covered by earlier tough levies imposed by the President. This is a developing story as the administration is yet to publish detailed documentation of its tariff plans, so we can't assess what tariff would apply to a device that includes components made in Taiwan and Vietnam, before being partly assembled in South Korea and completed in the USA. The Register will update this story if more useful material becomes available. ® At time of writing, in after-hours trading already: Apple shares down 7 percent, Amazon down 6, Meta down 5, Nvidia down 5, Microsoft down 3, Alphabet down 4, Cisco down 3, IBM down 2, HPE down 4, HP Inc down 5, Intel down 4, AMD down 5, Arm down 5, Qualcomm down 3, TSMC down 5, Dell down 6... \nPS: 'De minimis' exemptions for imported packages under $800 from China and Hong Kong will end on May 2, affecting Temu, Shein, and similar internet souks.\n Send us news",

The latter is something that Apple has been working on for years by diversifying its manufacturing out from China. \r All of the moves here are expensive ones, costing companies billions. They also take a lot of time to not only come into fruition, but to actually prove themselves to be good moves for Apple's bottom line.",

      "full_content": "United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino was in charge at Tottenham between 2014 and 2019 and has also managed Paris St-Germain and Chelsea United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino had sections of his former club's fanbase giddy with excitement last week after he declared his desire to one day return to Tottenham. It isn't a new concept, Pochettino has previously been clear in his wish to become Spurs head coach for a second period - but the current conjecture over incumbent Ange Postecoglou's future has sharpened the issue. The Argentine remains a hero among some of the regulars at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Joining in 2014, Pochettino led the team to second and third placed finishes in the Premier League and a Champions League final. Photos of Pochettino sharing a coffee with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, that went viral on social media last week, served only to amplify affections among supporters who pine for his return. The fact the photos are not recent, certainly not taken over the past 10 days, won't quell the fervour. Pochettino is under pressure in his current job. With a home World Cup in 2026 just 15 months away, his US side have lost consecutive Concacaf Nations League matches in the past week - beaten by Panama and Canada. Yet, dig deeper and you realise the prospect of the 53-year-old returning to Spurs any time soon is hugely unlikely. The United States Soccer Federation would be owed what has been described by a well-placed source as \"one of the biggest financial compensation fees in football history\" if Pochettino was to leave for Spurs - or any other team for that matter - before the next World Cup. Chelsea's Â£21m payment to Brighton to land Graham Potter after sacking Thomas Tuchel in 2022 and Bayern Munich's Â£21m to RB Leipzig to pave the way for Julian Nagelsmann's appointment in 2021 are, according to reports, ranked as the two largest managerial compensation packages in history. Pochettino signed a two-year contract in September, with multiple reports stating he earns Â£4.6m a year. However, it is understood the sum US Soccer would recoup if Pochettino leaves before next year's tournament, which they are hosting along with Canada and Mexico, extends way beyond the his salary and much closer to the amount Chelsea and Bayern, respectively, paid to land Potter and Nagelsmann. Would Pochettino return progress Spurs? Pochettino's recent remarks appeared to swing the door open towards him replacing Postecoglou should the Australian lose his job before next season. \"I am in the USA, so I am not going to talk about that now - but what I said then I still, after six years or five years, feel in my heart,\" he said last week. \"Yes, I would like one day to come back.\" However, according to well-placed sources, Pochettino has no immediate wish to return to Spurs. He is said to be fully committed to leading the US to a home World Cup. Of course, the mammoth cost of releasing Pochettino from his current deal lends itself to a singular focus, with the notion of any club - particularly one with a chairman as financially astute as Daniel Levy - parting with such a sizeable sum as being far-fetched. Yet, you get the sense Pocehttino's desire to lead the US to the World Cup is genuine and not a mindset borne out of stipulations relating to his contract. Indeed, during the same interviews in which he re-affirmed his intention to one day return to Tottenham, the South American spoke of his engagement with his new team and the project ahead. \"For us, the pressure is going to be there [at the World Cup] because we are a host,\" he said. \"And then it's a country where the mentality is about winning. In sport, in everything that Americans are involved in, they want to win. \"The players know it's going to be massive pressure and now our president [Trump] likes to put pressure on, but it's welcome. That means we are going to feel the adrenaline we need to feel. We are ready to deliver.\" Tottenham Q&A: Does Postecoglou have a future at Spurs? Much of the hype surrounding Pochettino's hypothetical return to Spurs stems from the fact Postecoglou is by no means certain of remaining in charge heading into next season. Tottenham's disappointing season leaves him under scrutiny. They are in 14th place in the Premier League, having accumulated 34 points. Even if they win all their remaining nine matches, they would still fall short of last season's points total of 66. Their wait for a domestic trophy will extend into next season after being eliminated from both cup competitions. Postecoglou's only saving grace is Tottenham's run in the Europa League; they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals next month. Of course, if Spurs win that competition the season takes on a very different complexion. Not only would success in Europe end the club's 17-year wait for silverware but it would also see them qualify for next season's Champions League. Such a scenario would surely see Postecoglou strengthen his position. That is easier said than done, of course. Indeed, failure to win the Europa League would raise further uncertainty over Postecoglou's job moving forward. All current indications are that Tottenham want to get to the end of the season before reviewing the campaign and come to a decision. Results, though, will likely dictate the club's approach. Sunday's defeat by arch-rivals Canada has taken Pochettino's record as US head coach to five wins and three losses. Prior to the current international break, Pochettino's win ratio since replacing Gregg Berhalter in September was healthier. But losing to Panama - 1-0 in the semi-final of the Concacaf Nations League - and 2-1 to Canada in the third-placed play-off, has led to some negativity. Pochettino quickly moved to quell any disquiet after Sunday's defeat, saying: 'I've seen some times that teams that were building to play in the World Cup, they were not good until around the World Cup. \"I want to send a message to the fans, don't be pessimistic and don't get bad feelings. \"I think we have time because if we will be in this situation in one year time, for sure, I will tell you, 'Houston, we have a problem,' no?\" Pochettino said. \"In one year, if we're talking about that, it's because we have a big problem and we were not capable to discover, to try design a better strategy to provide to the team the capacity to play in a different way.  \"I think we have time and I prefer that that happened today than [you] know, in one year.\" Nevertheless, with around 15 months until the World Cup starts, this month's results will have fans apprehensive.

      "full_content": "Intel ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger has thrown shade on Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC's plans to build fabrication plants in the USA, saying the factories will do nothing to advance American semiconductor leadership. \"If you don't have R&D in the US, you will not have semiconductor leadership in the US,\" Gelsinger said, according to a report this week in the Financial Times. \"All of the R&D work of TSMC is in Taiwan, and they haven't made any announcements to move that,” Gelsinger pointed out, effectively asserting that manufacturing chips using technologies and processes developed outside the USA in a stateside factory means America won't lead the world in semiconductor fabrication. The chips themselves may be designed in the States, and fabbed in the country, but they'll be made using state-of-the-art techniques formulated in Taiwan and elsewhere, where the next-gen nodes will be devised. America at that point will be a useful overseas factory hub rather than a leader, appears to be Pat's argument. Gelsinger, whose tenure at Intel ended in early December when he was abruptly booted out, tried to turn Chipzilla into a contract manufacturing heavyweight capable of challenging market leader TSMC. His grand plan involved Intel spending over $100 billion on new fabs in the US, Europe, and the Middle East, and creating an independent foundry business to build chips for third-party customers and Intel itself. The former CEO hoped Intel’s foundry would be attractive to customers because the company developed an advanced manufacturing process called 18A that is thought to allow creation of chips that near the complexity and performance of products only TSMC has previously been able to fab. The strategy did not produce immediate positive results, as Intel’s foundry business unit recorded substantial losses – and meaningful production using the 18A process is yet to commence. Another sign that the foundry plan was not roaring ahead was the announcement that completion of two Intel fab projects in the US state of Ohio had been delayed until the late 2020s and may not open for business until as late as 2030. Less than a week later, TSMC announced its intention to plow a further $100 billion into chip plants located in the USA, in a bid to insulate its US customers from the threat of Trumpian tariffs. While Gelsinger shares his opinions from the sidelines, Intel’s foundry ambitions are now a matter for newly appointed CEO Lip Bu Tan to consider. He's yet to detail any new strategy publicly, but will have new help to develop one as a Thursday regulatory filing revealed three Intel directors won’t seek reelection. Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak, UC Berkeley College of Engineering Dean Tsu-Jae King Liu, and Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, a former professor at the University of Pennsylvania, will all exit Intel’s board later this year. In Intel’s annual report, which appeared on Thursday, Tan wrote he remains committed to Intel’s foundry ambitions, without explicitly endorsing Gelsinger’s strategy of making Intel a contract manufacturer. “To enable great products, I am equally focused on creating great process technology, which is core to our strategy for building a world-class foundry,” he wrote. \"We are excited to begin high-volume production on Intel 18A at our newest fab in Arizona later this year and look forward to continued work with the US administration to strengthen the country’s technology and manufacturing leadership,\" he said. \"While some companies are returning to the US or investing here for the first time, Intel never left — and we continue to expand our operations.\" ® Send us news",

      "full_content": "By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan prosecutors on Friday for the first time charged a Chinese ship captain with intentionally damaging undersea cables off the island in February, after a rise in sea cable malfunctions alarmed Taiwan officials amid tensions with China. Prosecutors say the man was captain of the Chinese-crewed Hong Tai 58, registered in Togo, which Taiwanese authorities detained after suspecting the ship had dropped anchor near an undersea cable off southwestern Taiwan, damaging it. The prosecutors' office in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan said they had charged the ship's Chinese captain, whom they identified only by his family name, Wang, with being responsible for damaging the cable. Wang has said he is innocent, but refused to provide details of the ship's owner and \"had a bad attitude\", the prosecutors said in a statement. Seven other Chinese nationals detained at the same time will not be charged and will be transported to China, prosecutors said, adding that the case was the island's first prosecution over damaging sea cables. Reuters was not able to determine the ship's ownership or immediately locate a lawyer representing the captain. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has previously accused Taiwan of \"manipulating\" possible Chinese involvement in the case, saying it was casting aspersions before the facts were clear. The cable damage has come on top of China's military activities around Taiwan, including war games, the latest of which Beijing held last week. On Friday, Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected 21 Chinese military aircraft operating near the island, taking part in a \"joint combat readiness drill\" with Chinese warships, something Taipei routinely reports. BLACKLIST Taiwan has reported five cases of sea cable malfunctions this year, compared with three each in 2024 and 2023, according to its digital ministry. Taiwan's coast guard has in recent months stepped up efforts to protect its sea cables, including monitoring a \"blacklist\" of close to 100 China-linked ships registered to a country other than that of its owner near Taiwan, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. Taiwan said in January it suspected a China-linked ship of damaging an undersea cable off its northern coast; the ship owner denied the accusations. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly complained about \"grey zone\" Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging. Taipei was alarmed after another Chinese-linked ship was suspected of damaging a different cable this year, prompting the navy and other agencies to step up efforts to protect the undersea communication links, which are vital to the island's connections to the rest of the world. Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it has experienced and damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Japan's Nikkei soared 9.1%, while South Korea's Kospi jumped 6.6%, taking the Seoul index out of bear market territory. Taiwan's composite index spiked 9.25%, staging a strong comeback just days after it logged its biggest one-day drop on record. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also gained 2%, while key indices in China also rose slightly. But investors are still looking to Beijing for reaction.  Trump not only excluded China from the pause on tariffs, but actually hiked them further, imposing tariffs on the country to a staggering 125% on Chinese exports on Wednesday.  The higher levy came just hours after Beijing announced retaliatory duties of 84% on American goods imported to China. Trump's steeper tariffs had been in effect for only about 12 hours when he said he would suspend them for the next 90 days. The announcement was made during Wall Street trading hours and sent U.S. stocks surging. In a post on Truth Social early Thursday, Trump wrote  \"What a day, but more great days coming!!!\" Analysts say Trump's higher tariffs on China will have a limited impact on the country's economy. T. Rowe Price analyst Wenli Zheng said in a research note that on one of China's main stock markets, Chinese businesses have a \"surprisingly low revenue exposure to the U.S.\" Still, many investors say they would rather see an end to this explosive trade war between the world's two largest economies. Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said on Thursday that China is prepared to continue fighting. \"Let me stress that tariff wars and trade wars have no winners. China does not want to fight them, but will not fear when they come our way,\" Lin said at a regularly scheduled press conference. Speaking from the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump repeated a previous assertion that China would eventually negotiate with the U.S. \"President Xi's a very smart guy and I think we'll end up making a very good deal,\" he said. The president added that he didn't think the U.S. would need to further increase tariffs to bring Beijing to the bargaining table. \"I can't imagine it,\" he said. China has signaled it is willing to negotiate, but only if the U.S. administration changes its attitude. \"If the U.S. really wants to talk, it should show an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" Lin, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Thursday. Meanwhile, several other Asian economies breathed a sigh of relief and welcomed more time to negotiate trade deals and avoid steeper tariffs. Nonetheless, a baseline tariff of 10% will remain in place for all countries during the 90-day suspension of higher tariffs that particularly targeted Asian manufacturing hubs, like Vietnam and Cambodia. \"Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss in more detail the economic and trade cooperation between Taiwan and the United States,\" said Lin Chia-lung, Taiwan's foreign minister. The island state sells billions of dollars worth of data servers and semiconductors to U.S. tech companies, though the latter were excluded from the most recent round of tariffs. Lin added that Taiwan is committed to buying more American goods and increasing investments in the U.S. Taiwan had been facing a 32% tariff hit on its exports to the U.S., before Trump announced his temporary reprieve. South Korea's top trade envoy, Cheong In-kyo, also said Thursday that the tariff suspension provides room for negotiations, according to Reuters. Cheong had flown to Washington to discuss with U.S. trade officials reducing tariff rates and nontariff trade barriers between the two countries. Japan and the United States are also due to begin trade talks soon. Ashish Valentine contributed to this report.",

      "full_content": "Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.  By Karen Freifeld (Reuters) -Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing could face a penalty of $1 billion or more to settle a U.S. export control investigation over a chip it made that ended up inside a Huawei AI processor, according to two people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Commerce has been investigating the world's biggest contract chipmaker's work for China-based Sophgo, the sources said. The design company's TSMC-made chip matched one found in Huawei's high-end Ascend 910B artificial intelligence processor, according to the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Huawei - a company at the center of China's AI chip ambitions that has been accused of sanctions busting and trade secret theft - is on a U.S. trade list that restricts it from receiving goods made with U.S. technology. TSMC made nearly three million chips in recent years that matched the design ordered by Sophgo and likely ended up with Huawei, according to Lennart Heim, a researcher at RAND's Technology and Security and Policy Center in Arlington, Virginia, who is tracking Chinese developments in AI. The $1 billion-plus potential penalty comes from export control regulations allowing for a fine of up to twice the value of transactions that violate the rules, the sources said. Because TSMC's chipmaking equipment includes U.S. technology, the company's Taiwan factories are within reach of U.S. export controls that prevent it from making chips for Huawei, or producing certain advanced chips for any customer in China without a U.S. license. Heim said that based on the design, which is for AI applications, TSMC should not have made the chip for a company headquartered in China, especially given the risk that it could be diverted to a restricted entity like Huawei. Shares of TSMC traded in the U.S. erased a nearly 3% gain to trade slightly lower after the news. Penalizing TSMC comes at a critical moment for U.S.-Taiwan relations as the two begin re-negotiating their trading relationship after Trump last week slapped a 32% levy on imports from Taipei. The tariffs exclude chips, but Trump has said his team is looking at levies on semiconductors. In March, TSMC said at the White House that it plans to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that includes building five additional chip facilities in coming years. Reuters could not determine how the Trump administration will proceed with TSMC or when the matter would be resolved. Top officials have said they plan to seek higher penalties for export violations. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined comment. TSMC spokesperson Nina Kao said in a statement that the company is committed to complying with the law. She added that TSMC has not supplied to Huawei since mid-September 2020 and that they are cooperating with the Commerce Department. Speaking to reporters in Taipei on Wednesday, Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said TSMC is a company that respects laws and regulations, but his ministry has not received any notification about a possible fine and he could not comment further. No public action has been taken against TSMC. But typically, Commerce issues a \"proposed charging letter\" to a company it believes has engaged in prohibited conduct. The letter usually cites the dates alleged violations took place, the value, and the formula for a civil penalty, and it gives the company 30 days to respond. MORE ENFORCEMENT At a conference in Washington last month, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke about the role of export control enforcement in addressing the threat from China. \"We are going to seek in this administration a dramatic increase in enforcement and fines for people who break the rules,\" Lutnick said. \"We have had enough of people trying to make a dollar supporting the people who seek to destroy our way of life.\" Jeffrey Kessler, who was confirmed in March as Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security to oversee U.S. export controls, was more targeted at his Feb. 27 nomination hearing, saying that reports of TSMC chips going to Huawei was \"a huge concern\" and that \"strong enforcement\" was critical. A 10-figure fine for export control violations would be rare. In 2023, BIS imposed a $300 million penalty on Seagate Technology Holdings as part of a settlement over its shipping over $1.1 billion worth of hard disk drives to Huawei, as first reported by Reuters. TSMC first came under scrutiny last fall. TechInsights, a Canadian tech research firm, took apart a Huawei 910B AI accelerator and found a TSMC die, as it's also called, in the multi-chip system. After the TechInsights finding, TSMC suspended shipments to Sophgo and, in November, as Reuters reported, the Commerce Department ordered the chipmaker to halt shipments to China of seven-nanometer or more advanced chips that could be used in AI applications. In January, Sophgo, which in October denied any business relationship with Huawei, was placed on the same Commerce department restricted trade list as Huawei. Sophgo could not be reached for comment. Huawei's Ascend 910B has been viewed as the most advanced mass-produced AI chip available from a Chinese company, providing an alternative to California-based industry leader Nvidia.

The jawbone belonged to a Denisovan man, according to the findings published   Thursday in the journal Science.\n     \n            “We’ve determined and shown over the past couple of years that these proteins can survive longer than DNA does, and that if we have decent recovery, we can say something about the evolutionary ancestry of a specimen,” said study coauthor Frido Welker, an associate professor of biomolecular paleoanthropology at the University of Copenhagen’s Globe Institute in Denmark.\n     \n            Fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan long have dredged up the bones of ancient animals — elephants, water buffalo and hyenas — in their nets, relics of an ice age past when sea levels were lower and the ocean channel was a land bridge.\n     \n            The Denisovan man likely lived on this strip of land that once existed between what’s now China and Taiwan. This discovery establishes the third place that the enigmatic ancient humans first identified in 2010 were definitively known to have lived and shows that the Denisovans occupied a diverse range of environments: Siberian mountains, the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau and the humid subtropical latitudes, Welker added.\n     \n            Fishermen who find fossils among their catch often sell their finds to antique shops, where collectors pick them up, said study coauthor Chun-Hsiang Chang, a curator of paleontology at Taiwan’s National Museum of Natural Science. The museum has thousands of fossils found from the seabed in its collection.\n     \n            One collector brought the jawbone, now identified as Denisovan,   to the museum wanting to know more about the specimen, and Chang said he immediately realized it was unusual and encouraged the collector to donate or sell the fossil to the museum, which he did.\n     \n            A paper Chang coauthored in 2015 argued the fossil belonged to the genus Homo, the grouping to which our species, Homo sapiens, and other ancient humans such as Neanderthals belong, but colleagues   were  not able to extract any ancient DNA from the fossil and couldn’t verify the exact species.\n     \nRelated article\nPuzzling fossils unearthed in China may rewrite the human story\n \n            It also wasn’t possible to date the fossil accurately. Scientists believe it has an age range of between 10,000 and 70,000 or 130,000 and 190,000 years old, dating the bone to a time when past sea levels in that vicinity  were low.\n     \n            Chang took the specimen to Copenhagen in 2022 hoping to learn more from Welker and other scientists who were pioneering techniques to extract proteins from fossils, a field known as paleoproteomics.\n     \n            Chang recalled airport security in Copenhagen stopping him when the case containing the jawbone passed through an X-ray machine.  “They stopped me and wanted me to open (the case),” he said. “I thought maybe they were going to arrest me.” Chang said he was allowed to leave only after sharing his credentials and giving the security personnel “a very short human evolution lesson.”\n     \n            Before testing the jawbone, Welker and his colleagues sampled an elephant bone and pig bone   from the same part of the seabed to work out which extraction methods would work best and determine whether proteins were still present. The team found proteins and proceeded with extracting them.\n \n            Two amino acid sequences from the proteins recovered from the specimen matched those known from the Denisovan genome — a complete set of genetic information sequenced from DNA. What’s more, the lab work detected a type of protein with a sex-specific peptide called amelogenin, and Y-chromosome specific peptides revealed that the Denisovan individual was male, Welker said.\n     \n            Denisovans were first identified in 2010 in a lab using DNA sequences extracted from a tiny fragment of finger bone found in Denisova Cave in Siberia’s Altai Mountains, which is how the group got its name.\n     \n            Genetic analysis subsequently revealed that the Denisovans, like Neanderthals, had once interbred with early modern humans. Traces of Denisovan DNA found in present-day people suggest the ancient species likely once lived across much of Asia, and the recent discovery of Denisovan fossils from outside their namesake cave has begun to show they occupied a wide range of places in Asia.\n     \nRelated article\nDenisovans were living on the Tibetan plateau surprisingly recently, scientists say\n \n            In 2019, scientists shared news that a jawbone found in a cave on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, known as the Xiahe mandible, contained a Denisovan molecular signature. A Denisovan rib bone from the same cave was reported in 2024.\n     \n            In 2022, scientists identified a tooth unearthed at a cave in Laos as Denisovan because it closely resembled the tooth from the Xiahe mandible. The clue placed the species in Southeast Asia for the first time, though scientists were not able to get any definitive molecular information from the molar to confirm it.\n     \n            The good preservation of the proteins in the Penghu 1 mandible is surprising, given that it had been at the bottom of the sea for a long time, said archaeologist Zhang Dongju, a professor at China’s Lanzhou University who worked on the Xiahe jawbone. She was not involved in the study.\n     \n            “With the accumulation of Denisovan fossils and the increase of Denisovan-specific molecular signature identified, identification of Denisovan fossils will be easier,” she said.  “And I believe more Denisovan fossils will be found and identified in (the) future. And we will know more about this mysterious species.”\n     \n            Katerina Douka, an associate professor in archaeological science at Austria’s University of Vienna, described Denisovans as a paradox because scientists have detailed genetic information about the species but few fossils, so little is known about how they looked, although she noted they had “exceptionally large” molars.\n     \n            The Penghu 1 and Xiahe mandibles did not have wisdom teeth, which could indicate that their jaws did not protrude forward in their face, said Ryan McRae, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.\n     \n            “Neither mandible has a chin, like modern humans do, so the front of their jawline would probably look flatter than ours,” McRae said by email. “The authors wisely point out that the Penghu mandible is male, which means that it may exhibit the larger, more robust end of variation for this species. In other words, female Denisovans could look the same, or quite different, we just don’t know yet.”\n     \n            Douka and McRae weren’t involved in the study.\n     \n            The mysterious humans don’t have a widely accepted official species name yet, although some scientists have suggested Homo juluensis, a classification that groups  Denisovan fossils with other fossils from China, including “dragon man,” a skull described in 2021. \n \n            Chang said that he and his colleagues hope to revisit the 4,000 or so fossils in the National Museum of Natural Science’s collection that have been gathered from the seabed in the Taiwan Strait over the past 40 to 50 years and use the same proteomic methods applied to the Penghu 1 jawbone to investigate whether any other fragments belong to Denisovans.\n     \n            “Maybe inside my collection there’s some treasure we don’t know about,” Chang said.",

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he threatened Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company with a \"big tax\" of up to 100% if the chipmaker didn't build its plants in America. Trump was speaking at a dinner event organized by the National Republican Congressional Committee when he criticized the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022. \"These chip companies are loaded. They give these companies billions of dollars to build a plant in the United States. They don't build them in the US,\" Trump said Tuesday. The Biden administration said in November that it had awarded TSMC up to $6.6 billion in funding to build three chip factories in Phoenix. TSMC's first factory in Phoenix faced construction delays initially but started producing chips last year. Last month, TSMC said it would invest $100 billion to build five new chip factories in the US. The company said the investment was on top of the $65 billion it announced in April 2024. Trump said on Tuesday that he'd convinced TSMC to deepen its manufacturing footprint in the US without offering more funding. \"All I did is say, 'If you don't build your plant here, you are going to pay a big tax. Twenty-five, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100%,'\" Trump said. TSMC declined to comment when approached by Business Insider. Trump has threatened companies with tariffs in the past. While on the campaign trail in September, Trump said he'd impose a 200% tariff on John Deere if the agriculture equipment company moved its manufacturing to Mexico. Last week, Trump announced a slate of reciprocal tariffs on more than 180 countries. The tariffs, which start at a baseline rate of 10%, took effect on Wednesday. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Thursday that while the tariffs didn't apply to semiconductors, Trump was still thinking about how he could restore the US's foothold in chip making. \"Donald Trump's going to deeply study those. And those are going to come later on how to reshore from Taiwan all that semiconductor manufacturing,\" Lutnick said. \"We have to protect ourselves at some point. America has to be able to protect itself.\" Representatives for the White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",

      "full_content": "A Naples landmark has received a top honor for one its most popular and unique attractions. The Naples Zoo has been named in USA Today's 10Best Readers' Choice Awards for 2025. The national news publication rated the Naples Zoo's Primate Expedition Cruise eighth among the 10 best zoo exhibits across the country for 2025.  \"The best zoo exhibits not only educate but also engage visitors by transporting them to another place, whether it be the foothills of the Himalayas, a Florida swamp, or to an island in Madagascar,\" USA Today said in announcing the winners. \"But which zoo exhibits are the most impressive, immersive, and informative in the country?\" USA Today asked a panel of experts to nominate their top picks, then readers voted to determine the winners. The Naples Daily News is part of Gannett, which publishes USA TODAY and more than 200 local news sites nationwide. The Naples Zoo exhibit was one of two in Florida that were recognized. \"The Primate Expedition Cruise is a unique opportunity only found at Naples Zoo where visitors climb aboard a catamaran for a 15- to 20-minute cruise around islands where monkeys, gibbons, and lemurs cavort in their own tropical paradise,\" USA Today's 10Best said. \"This unique lake habitat contains multiple primate-friendly islets complete with climbing structures, hammocks, and fruit trees. The cruise's design maintains primates' privacy and visibility simultaneously — they can retreat into foliage or venture closer to passing boats. These naturalist-guided tours share insights about each species' adaptations and social structures, while the boat's design ensures every seat is prime viewing real estate.\" In the past year, Naples Zoo officials said, it welcomed more than 425,000 visitors, with more than 285,000 embarking on a Primate Expedition Cruise. Top 5 things to do this weekend: Free concert, Earth Day, Celebrate Bonita! Officially known as Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens, it opened in 1969 and sits on 43 acres and in 2019 celebrated 100 years as a botanical garden and 50 years as a zoo. The primate cruise opened in 1992, and through the years, has remained perhaps the most popular attraction because it offers a respite from the heat while people can observe fascinating animals.

      "full_content": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has lodged a protest with China about a statement that misquoted Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's remarks during Friday's meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Japan's top government spokesperson said on Monday. An announcement by China's foreign ministry on Friday said Ishiba had said Japan \"respects\" the positions of the Chinese side, as detailed by Wang during the meeting. Wang stressed Japan should \"fulfil important political commitments on historical issues and the Taiwan question,\" and that Tokyo should send \"the right signal to the world with a responsible attitude towards history, the people and the future,\" according to China's statement on the meeting. But Japan's foreign ministry said on Saturday that \"no such statement was ever made,\" and asked China to delete the incorrect material. \"We've protested to the Chinese side and immediately requested the removal of the announcement, stating that it was not factual,\" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a press conference. He did not disclose the details, including the Chinese response, but said \"it is regrettable that the non-factual announcement was issued\". During the meeting, Ishiba stressed the necessity of reducing concerns and issues between the two nations, including the situation in the East China Sea, early release of Japanese nationals detained in China and lifting import restrictions on Japan's marine and agricultural products, Japan's foreign ministry said. China's foreign ministry said on Monday the meeting between Wang and Ishiba was \"important and beneficial\" and \"embodied the spirit of mutual respect\". \"Isn't it normal to respect each other's positions in state-to-state relations?\" ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in response to a question about Japan's protest. On Monday afternoon, the statement on China's foreign ministry website still included the Ishiba remarks Japan had requested removed.

      "full_content": "President Trump’s sweeping global tariffs have rocked the stock market since being announced on Tuesday, with just about every major tech company down double-digits. Semiconductors were largely spared from an immediate impact, however, as chips from Taiwan and other nations were exempted. Most electronics sold in the United States are powered by chips made in Asia, meaning tariffs would have a significant impact on prices. But Trump told a White House press pool on Thursday that tariffs on semiconductors will be imposed “very soon.” Already, tariffs on foreign-made goods have led Nintendo to announce a delay in U.S. pre-orders for the Switch 2 while it assesses the potential impact of tariffs. And Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later startup made a meme for letting customers pay for food deliveries in installments, delayed its planned IPO on Friday. Global economic uncertainty probably hurts the business case for financing Chipotle burritos through zero-interest, unsecured loans. President Trump had already threatened to impose large tariffs on semiconductors made abroad as the United States aims to build more crucial technology domestically. China’s closure of Shanghai in 2022 over a COVID-19 outbreak highlighted the risk of relying on long, international supply chains for essential manufacturing. TSMC, one of the major chipmakers that makes products for the likes of Nvidia and Apple, has committed more than $100 billion to open production and R&D facilities in the United States, but scaling takes a long time. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimated it would take Apple three years and $20 billion to move ten percent of manufacturing to the U.S. If President Trump is trying to make the United States more competitive in manufacturing, it makes some sense to include chips in tariffs. Domestic manufacturers like Intel rely on foreign-made hardware to build their chips locally, and with tariffs in place, that hardware will cost more, subsequently meaning the chips themselves will not be competitive to those built abroad. Tom’s Hardware detailed how prices of chips could increase under new tariffs: For example, if there is a 25% tariff on an Nvidia AI GPU that the company sells for $50,000 with a 75% gross margin, then Nvidia will have to declare a value of $12,500 and pay an import duty of $3,125. Such a tariff will either hurt Nvidia’s margins or make its GPUs more expensive for buyers in America. For Elon Musk’s next-generation data centers, which are set to contain a million GPUs, this means $3.125 billion of additional costs. President Trump has said that the tariffs imposed on Wednesday are meant to create a level playing field for manufacturing. And while it makes sense to move some manufacturing back to the United States, doing so takes many years. Products made domestically will still surely be more expensive than alternatives made abroad. Labor in the United States is expensive, and worker protections and regulations add to that burden. America has long been a service economy; people in the U.S. do not want to do hard labor. Certain sectors like chipmaking may be viable to reshore to the United States as they are higher margin businesses than commodity goods like toasters or shoes. But it is unclear whether physical products made in the United States would ever be competitive globally, and manufacturers would still need to import rare earth metals that are not found in U.S. soil. The largest economy in the world is adept at services—designing products, writing code—and leaving the elbow work to other countries. Even if manufacturing of durable goods does come back to America, there is a widespread belief that much of it will be automated, such as with Tesla’s Optimus robot. Amazon has continued to invest heavily in automating its factories. Under tariffs one could envision Americans paying more for lower-quality goods, especially making the new tax regressive to low-income Americans. And for businesses, they could make U.S. companies less competitive because their costs of doing business will be higher. And this is at a time when China is racing ahead in fields like AI and automotive. Many economists believe that a budget deficit, which the U.S. currently faces, means the country spends more importing goods than it does exporting. But there are other ways to balance the books that would not harm Americans in the process, like negotiating down drug prices. Tariff differences similarly could be ameliorated without creating enemies. All countries support their domestic industries to some extent, such as by subsidizing agriculture. Some middle ground could theoretically be achieved. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell said on Friday that Trump’s tariffs will likely stoke “higher inflation and slower growth,” and warned that unemployment could rise after several months of strength. But he added that the Federal Reserve is not going to immediately lower interest rates, which could dampen the impact. Which is to say, Powell does not plan on bailing out Trump despite widespread criticism of the tariffs amongst the business community. \nNvidiaPoliticspresident trumpTariffsTSMC  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          It's the Art of the Deal.\n         \n          Tesla's factory in Shanghai only produces the carmaker's more affordable models, with the Model S and X imported from the U.S.\n         \n          On again, off again.\n         \n          As the Trump administration continues to play hardball with China, American businesses are raising their prices.\n         \n          The China Film Administration said it would moderately reduce the amount of US imports that make it to the country's theaters.\n         \n          A planned export restriction was reportedly cancelled after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million per-head dinner at Mar-a-Lago.",

      "full_content": "All your favorite tech is soon going to hit the wall of tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. Already, the tariffs are forcing Nintendo to revise its Switch 2 preorder timeline, potentially making an expensive $450 handheld console even more expensive. If you want to buy a new laptop, phone, light, or practically any electronic, you should do it now, or else hold off buying anything new until the next hair-brained scheme snails its way from the Trump White House. Trump’s White House implemented its tariff scheme on Wednesday, but “Liberation Day,” as the president called it, was met by confusion from the get-go. Eventually, reporters managed to confirm a 10% on practically every country or landmass the world over, including the uninhabited Heard and McDonald islands. The tariffs, epitomized by a 54% tariff on Chinese goods, are based on an obtuse mathematical formula that doesn’t make a lot of sense but does make gadgets a lot pricier. Other neighboring countries like Vietnam (46% tariff), Cambodia (49%), and Taiwan (32%) were some of the hardest hit by Trump’s decree. Unfortunately these are some of the countries that tech companies rely on most for manufacturing. Big tech firms invested heavily in Vietnamese manufacturing since the trade war between the U.S. and China started heating up last time Trump was in office. U.S. Census Bureau data shows the country counts as the sixth top source for imported goods to the U.S. Tech firms both big and small each have to determine how much of the cost they need to pass onto the consumer versus how much of the difference they want to eat themselves. Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told The Verge companies are going to be incentivized to lay “a good share” of the cost of tariffs onto downstream consumers. The only saving grace is that consumers have a small, shrinking window when they can buy some electronics before the price increases start in earnest. Miller told The Verge that companies have imported 70% more products into the U.S. over the past few months than in the same time in 2023. So for now, you may still find all your tech at the pre-tariff price. But don’t expect the current prices to last. It’s better to assume companies will raise prices sooner rather than later. In February, major PC and device maker Acer announced it was raising prices by around 10% due to tariffs. It’s only a matter of time before they go even higher. If you want another scary example of how tech could get much more expensive in the months ahead, look at Apple. Apple relies on Vietnam for much of its manufacturing. A report from Reuters based on industry analyst predictions proposed a $1,142 price tag for the iPhone 17 under these new tariffs. That’s close to $350 more expensive than an $800 iPhone 16. The highest-end iPhone Pro Max with max 1 TB storage might cost close to $2,300 using the same math. The Cheeto-in-chief suggested on Friday he could impose tariffs specifically targeting semiconductors “very soon.” This would take already expensive tech and make it untenable for most consumers in the U.S. The idea is these tariffs are supposed to bring manfucaturing back to the U.S, but it won’t happen overnight. It takes time to build up the manufacturing apparatus, especially something as complicated as chips. Intel is set to receive $7.9 billion from the U.S. through the CHIPS act enacted under the tenure of President Joe Biden. The company was building an Ohio chip foundry, but that project has been delayed to an expected opening date of 2030. Trump recently pushed an executive order that would punish companies by withholding CHIPS funding if they didn’t invest in U.S. manufacturing. So yes, your phones, tablets, and laptops with all their silicon could get way, way more expensive if Trump follows through on additional tariffs, but that’s not all. As noted by CNN, modern cars rely on more than 1,000 semiconductor chips with some having over 3,000. There’s no upside here. The tariffs are already incentivizing layoffs at companies like Stellantis. So while economic uncertainty may be pushing you to hold off on any spending sprees, wouldn’t you rather be unemployed with a Steam Deck than without a Steam Deck? \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.",

      "full_content": "Apple and its customers can breathe a sigh of relief today after the White House carved tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, and more. The iPhone maker was facing a 145% fee on products imported into the United States from China. This caused weeks of speculation that the iPhone and other electronics could be subject to price hikes to cover the cost. Bloomberg reported on the tariff exemption policy development: The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump’s 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries. The exclusions would apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years. The products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers. The move follows a week of policy and market volatility in which the White House issued tariff increases across the board for imports, reset tariff rates for 90 days for most countries except for China, and stated that the iPhone could be built in the USA. But as Bloomberg’s coverage suggests, the tech industry may not be out of the woods yet. That’s because the Trump administration may be planning sector-specific tariff rates separate from the 145% tariff rate put on imports from China. For now, the return to a 10% tariff rate on electronics will likely offer relief to Apple and consumers who were rushing to buy products at pre-tariff prices over the last few days.

      "full_content": "Earlier this week I wrote an article called “A US-Made iPhone Is Pure Fantasy.\" The long and short of it is that Trump’s dream of moving all high tech manufacturing to the US is extremely difficult because global supply chains are so intricate, manufacturing expertise exists primarily in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and other countries, and the components that go into a phone are often made in other countries as well. But there is currently one smartphone that qualifies for a “Made in the USA” title from the FTC. It’s the Liberty Phone, which is made by a company called Purism. The phone is a version of Purism’s Librem 5. The Made-in-China Librem 5 costs $800, and the Liberty phone costs $2,000. It has 4 GB of memory, and reviewers say that its specs are pretty outdated. Not every single component in the Liberty Phone is made in the USA, but the company has been trying very hard to make it as American-made as possible. The fact that it exists at all is kind of a miracle, and the way that Purism is approaching manufacturing is really interesting, so I called Purism’s founder, Todd Weaver, to talk about smartphone supply chains, making tech products in the United States, and tariffs. Here’s our discussion, which has been edited for length and clarity. The full, hour-long discussion is available here as a bonus episode of the 404 Media podcast:  404 Media: What you're doing is super interesting and I know you've been doing it for a while. I know that there's been tons of discussion over the last few weeks about bringing manufacturing back to the United States, the difficulty of doing that with different supply chains and components and things like that. And I know to the best of your ability, you've brought the Liberty Phone to the U.S. Can you tell me a little bit about what the Liberty Phone is and how long you've been doing it for?  Todd Weaver: So the first thing is I started the company, Purism, in 2014. The original business plan is actually what we were able to execute on over the course of the last 10 years, and looking at doing a fair number of things different than is currently done. One of those is US manufacturing for a lot of reasons, secure supply chain, where we get to manage all the components, full transparency, I can also release my schematics. And then that gets us to where we're really targeting that security market as well, because the security market needs to have control and also verify the claims of any technology stack being used. When I started the company, we also did laptops. And then I knew I wanted to get to the point of phones. But I also knew that I had to increment my way there by building laptops first, showcasing that I'm able to do all of that on the hardware, software services side, and then get to the point of the phone. When we did the phone, it was the Librem 5 phone. After we were successful on the Librem 5 crowdfunding campaign, we took our own electronics engineers (EEs), and then we worked with Chinese design and manufacturing through 2018, 2019, and 2020, because that's where every phone is made. We had to leverage the knowledge base that was offshored into that country to do so. And so at that point, we were able to take our designs and educate our staff on the entire process and produce the Librem 5. And then we were able to take all those designs and spin up our own SMT, it's called Surface Mount Technology, where we can actually produce the entire electronics of the device at our facility, therefore bringing it back to US soil. And so we have a few different SKUs of our product offering that are manufactured in our facility.  We have a varying degree of the country of origin for components or the total product. So on one end of that spectrum, you have our server, which is an Intel reference design manufactured out of China, and then we're importing it. And then you go through the whole scale all the way down to Liberty Phone and our Librem Key that are 100% produced at our facility in Carlsbad, California. On those two products we take the printed circuit board, which is just a blank board that has no components and run that through our surface mount technology by our line operators. And so we go from resistors and capacitors and integrated circuits, put them all on the board, take it off the board, do quality control, any firmware loading. Then we assemble the entire phone and then do a software load for the customer and then ship it direct. That whole process is top to bottom done at our facility. There’s a difference between a phone that is fully made and manufactured in the United States and one that is assembled in the United States. Do you believe that you're manufacturing the phone from start to finish in the United States? There's no question about it. The difference is actually defined by the FTC. So the Federal Trade Commission has language that describes the difference between assembled and manufactured. Assembly is where you are putting parts together. And they actually even have a sub definition of that called screwdriver assembly. So if you only take a screwdriver to it, and that's the only tool you're using, meaning snapping parts and using a screwdriver, then you cannot claim it was ‘made in the USA’ or you can't even claim ‘assembled in the USA.’ When you're looking at the Liberty phone, we are taking the bare board and we are doing the entire manufacturing process of all of the electronics, meaning resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits are being put onto that board. It's going from raw materials to finished goods at our facility. And then we assemble the entire printed circuit board into the actual chassis of the phone. And then we also load our own operating system and then ship it to the customer. So, not only are we doing full electronics manufacturing at our facility on US soil, but we're also doing the entire operating system and authorship and releasing of that.  You're not buying components from overseas and then screwing them together here? You're making the components here as well? Components are the things that you're actually purchasing like a resistor and a capacitor and integrated circuit. Those we are buying from a Western distributor and each chip set that you use has a country of origin. In our case, we also use chip sets that are like ST Micro [a Swiss company with American factories], Texas instruments. These are manufactured on US soil. So we also go down as deep as we possibly can to purchase from US or Westernized distribution or manufacturers of those components and chips. So obviously resistors, capacitors are manufactured on US oil. We purchase those and install them. When you're talking about the PCB, which is the blank board and the PCBA, which is the printed circuit board assembly. You're taking those raw components and you're putting them onto a board, meaning soldering them onto a board, and then you have a finished electronic circuit board. When you're talking about other companies, what they're importing is typically finished goods, finished electronics. Meaning the chassis, the battery, the whole entire electronics inside. And in rare cases, they might import just the motherboard, meaning the printed circuit board or PCBA assembly. We're very unique in the sense that we actually go from parts in stock all the way to the manufacturing process, all the way to finished goods at our facility. It is a vertically integrated manufacturing process. And that is, as you can recognize, extremely rare. The last part of this is the raw materials, the minerals that are being mined and turned into the different parts that you're sourcing from suppliers. Do you try to work with suppliers who are making parts using materials mined in the US? Or is that too hard to follow that deep into the supply chain? Yes, we do, but there's levels of complexity, as you can imagine, where the desire is there, but sometimes the parts aren't, or sometimes the negotiation with the suppliers turn into much more challenging or time consuming for the scale that we happen to be at. And then there's another bit of that, which also is leverage. If you're talking millions of units, as a manufacturer you have a lot more leverage than if you have a hundred thousand or tens of thousands. And so there is a degree of how hard can you push into the supply chain for contractual sourcing of raw materials, meaning mined materials. What we tend to do when we're doing Liberty phone is use Western distribution which has to comply with an awful lot more regulation on where it can source components from.  Our philosophy from the very early days, especially as it relates to US manufacturing, is we go as deep as we possibly can to releasing our schematics, to sourcing our components, to having our HBOM, it's called a hardware bill of materials, a country of origin available, to the transparency of all of our source code that we author being published as well so you can verify that all of our claims are accurate. How long did it take you to implement this vision for manufacturing everything in the United States?  2017 was when we actually began to say ‘We want to manufacture a phone and we would like to do it on US soil.’ We then actually manufactured our Librem Key as a very small security token at the same facility, same US soil manufacturing process. But it was a much easier product to produce, but that also showed, hey, we're able to do it on a simpler product.  Then in 2019, we were able to get what's called PVT samples. That's where you sort of get the initial versions of hardware being produced. So that two years is really about design changes that we needed, developing every bit out. But also in parallel to that, we were educating our electronic engineers to say, every time we're sourcing a Chinese resistor [a circuit board component], let's make sure we're getting the same resistance on a US resistor. We always were sort of maintaining two different bills of materials of Chinese componentry and Western componentry because they're different. Then we produced five different iterations of the Librem 5 phone through Chinese contract manufacturing. And we iterated through those five changes over the course of about 18 months. At that point, we finally had a production ready product. And then we were able to take everything that we did and bring it to US soil.  [The Librem 5 USA was released in 2020, after three years of development.] Imagine this literally starting from scratch, you're looking at probably a three year cycle from, from ‘Let's take an existing made-in-China product and then just produce the same thing in the US.’  Were there specific components or specific parts of the phone that were harder to source in the United States or harder to manufacture in the United States because we don't make that type of component in the US or there's not a US supplier that sells it? Yes. There's US-manufactured, and then there’s ‘Westernized’ sourcing, so something from Germany or Europe or Canada. There's a bunch of these where you can’t get a US-component but you can get a ‘Western’ component. And then there’s things you can’t get [from a Western manufacturer]. One specific item is a type of crystal that needs to be put into phones, which is basically for keeping track of time and a few other measurement metrics. That crystal is something that only comes from China, and maybe I think you can get it from South Korea, which is where we either are sourcing or trying to source that last component from. Even where we care to do 100 percent of it, there's still always something that you can try and dig one level deeper and you realize, that's a mineral or a mineral resource of something that's coming from somewhere that would be outside of the U.S. So then you need to import it and you wonder, ‘Is that ever going to be produced in the US or is there some company who would like to begin doing so?’ It's obviously a very complex question when you're dealing with, you know, in our case, 200 unique parts and the entire sourcing of all of them. You can imagine the majority of companies who are just selling electronics from manufacturers somewhere else, they don't care. There's no transparency, no visibility, and the company itself doesn't even know the designs or what goes into it. Your table of component origins on the Liberty Phone site shows where things come from. Most of it is USA, but then you have the M2 Modem module that says its origin declaration is China. Is there a specific reason that’s not USA?  The M2 module, we actually have options for US made and then we also have European, Germany. That module, specifically for cellular, it depends on the bands that you're looking to install it at or in some cases cost, right? So we have that as an actual module that you can snap in. The one that we ship for when we sell the [Chinese-made] Librem 5 is a Chinese modem. But we have a US-made one and a few other westernized countries for that modem module. We have the options of different bands, different country of origin, and to be able to put that in after the fact or during final assembly. But I would just imagine that the Chinese one is a lot cheaper. Yeah, absolutely. It's cheaper, it also has pretty wide bands.  The phone that you were able to manufacture in the United States is not as fast as the latest iPhone. Can the newest best chips and components be manufactured in the US, and what would it take to do it here? The short answer is yes, I do, because you didn't ask me the timing. It's going to be multiples of years and a major investment and undertaking. And it has to show that there's a ROI and that there’s stability, like ‘This is the future that we’re going to live in, so let’s actually invest in doing all those things.’ When you're talking chipsets, the actual CPUs inside of Apple and Samsung and Google phones, those are a complete computer where it's hardware, the CPU, memory, and baseband modem, the cellular modem all combined onto one. And typically that's from Qualcomm or MediaTek. And those particular chipsets are produced outside of China. So really what you're referring to is the actual design of a finished good saying, take the semiconductor and put it into a phone and then add all the other components, the 200 and some other unique components into the finished good. And that is done in China specifically for Apple and a bunch of other major manufacturers. It's obviously far more complex, but to try and just level set a little bit about that, where you're at now is you say ‘Let's take what we have in China and try to replicate that in the U.S.’ Well, the challenge is that all high tech jobs were put into China. You have a brain transfer where the ODMs, the original design manufacturers, are in China. If you scoured the United States, you would be able to probably actually still count the number of skilled electronics engineers. If you go to Shenzhen, there's floor after floor after floor after floor of skilled EE's.  These are people who design the actual board that goes into devices. That training takes time and effort and energy to get to the point where you can design new devices.  Then you have the next step, which is the actual assembly process. When you're looking at costing, machine versus machine, it's the same price to produce a product in US or China. Because the machine is doing the effort.  But then you have a person who physically grabs the board and does the assembly, which is a much more costly endeavor in the US than it is in China. China can solve problems by throwing people at it. The US and Western countries can solve problems by throwing engineering at it. If you were to go to Dongguan, China, and you see a manufacturing line, they're going to have rows and rows and rows of people who are taking a tablet or a phone that passes by them, and they just do [quality assurance on] pinch to zoom. They have gloves and they touch the screen, drag it open and drag it back and then it moves on the line. If one doesn't do pinch to zoom properly, they send it back. And that is a job for an entire row of people.  But what we did at Purism is we solved it with engineering. How we do that is we actually plug in the phone and we flash the entire device and we run through what we call auto Quality Assurance. And that is where we actually hack the firmware to receive or fake to receive a touch screen event into the firmware itself on the screen. And then we actually replicate a pinch to zoom, take a picture and then back again and take another picture. And as long as those pictures match, we have a functioning touch interface, where we didn't have to have people doing that task.  You can look at our concrete numbers. We sell a Chinese made Librem 5 phone for $799. We sell the Liberty phone for $2,000. When you're looking at just those numbers alone, that looks like a giant leap in cost. But there's a couple of factors that are not publicly known when you're looking at just those prices. When you're looking at COGS, cost of goods sold, our Librem 5 phone is equivalent in cost to about an iPhone. It's about $500 and some odd dollars, $550. So we can see that the Librem 5 phone doesn't have a very high margin when we sell it. The Liberty phone, same COGS componentry wise, but to produce it on US soil, we're adding not quite a hundred dollars. So it's about $650 to produce that entire phone. But what we're doing by selling it for greater originally, we're looking at a lot of differentiators for us. It wasn't just made in the USA. It's the fact that it's a secure supply chain, that you know, staff that's completely auditing every component, which means we're selling to a government security market with all those additional layers that we've added on top. Do you feel like you are in a better spot tariffs-wise than a company that is doing all of their manufacturing in China because you've done all of this? Absolutely, without question. If there’s a vertically integrated company where they have engineers, they have designers, they have the knowledge to be able to do it, then those companies will be able to adapt and bring it forth. If they choose to do US manufacturing, they have at least the ability to. Whereas a company that is marketing and finance, and that's really the bulk of what they're doing, and they don't have any engineering, and they've offloaded all of those tasks. If they have no R&D budget, and they have no operating expenses for any type of engineering or manufacturing, then they're gonna be in a very difficult position because you can also imagine there's kind of a run on the bank, right? Everybody is going to be looking for a company who can build their product at the same time. They have no knowledge of how to do it because that entire process has been brought into China. In China, you’re basically talking to a project manager, who's finding all of the right parties that does all the other tasks, and then they bring in all the engineers and everything else that's needed operationally and what you're receiving at the end of the day is something you can drop ship to a customer without ever actually even opening the box. It’s going to be very challenging to find someone in the US who's going to fill that same void at the same time that everybody else is looking to see if they can fill that void. You are doing this manufacturing in Carlsbad, California. Did you find it difficult to find workers who were able to work on a high tech factory line? We did not have difficulty in finding line operators, or what we call ‘skilled labor’ where you're able to solder something or do assembly with tweezers. That type of skilled labor exists, but it’s also in [geographical] pockets. If you're to say ‘Why in the world are you in Carlsbad, California?’ It's because there’s skilled labor there. There's companies here that currently work for government contract manufacturers, so that's where the labor is, that's why it was easy for us to spin up a line there and hire skilled labor from some of the other companies who have trained up those same staff.  Electronics engineers is a rarer position. And that's what I was describing earlier when you scour the nation you'd come up with, you could count the number of skilled electronics engineers on US soil and there's probably a million in Shenzhen alone.  One thing that I worry about or think might be a problem is if you have tons of companies trying to do this all at once, very quickly, what is that going to be like? Are there enough skilled people to do that here? The answer has to be no. There's enough skilled labor to handle the necessary manufacturing that we're currently doing and you know if you increment it slowly then you can probably get there. If you're talking full EEs, that's multi years of education to get to the point of actually being able to do proper designs that actually work.  There's another bit that you sort of hinted at there that I think is important, and I’m going to address it. The reliability of knowing that a tariff is in place and how long it's going to be in place allows a business to make informed decisions. If it was something where you knew that importing from China is going to be a hundred percent tariff for the next 10 years concretely, every business owner would be making decisions based off of that assumption, and the reliability of that assumption is important.  If it's something where ‘Hey, this is what's going to be 100%, but in two months it might not be, and who knows what's going to happen in three years or four years?’ It makes it very hard for a business owner or the board of directors to say ‘It's worth spinning all this up.’  Did you look at bringing manufacturing to the US as a political project for you? Were you interested in the politics of doing this in the United States or was it a matter of differentiating yourselves? There's like probably about 10 items on the list of reasons why we chose to do manufacturing in the US. And obviously one of those is from a civil liberties perspective. So manufacturing high tech componentry in a hostile nation to the United States is not good geopolitical politics, right? Purism as a company, we also care tremendously about civil liberties and the privacy side of things which is to say we manufacture a phone that doesn't spy on you. That's why we manufacture it and also do all the source code. We can't have some nefarious chip put into the supply chain from a hostile country.  So the short answer is not in the short-term political game, but more of the geopolitical game and also understanding security and privacy and sort of how all those things weave together  I think no matter where you are on the political spectrum, you can look at the last two weeks of tariffs, more tariffs, maybe not tariffs, maybe a delay in tariffs, increased Chinese tariffs and agree that this is chaotic. And you mentioned the stability of sort of knowing what the rules are going to be. Does this all stress you out? I do not stress about the SKUs that we are fully making in the US, right? We don't have to worry about it for our US side, because the majority of it will not be affected. But for others [that we make overseas], you can’t project out, right? What is it gonna be in three months? Should we buy components now? What is it gonna be a year from now? Maybe we should stock up on a bunch of other things? Should we buy it today? Then maybe somebody on your procurement team says, ‘Well, maybe we should wait a week, right?’ Because if it's going to change, is it going to change for the better or worse? And you can imagine those little micro example carries forward to everything else that a business has to decide If the tariff from China is 100%, and you know it is going to be 100 % for the next 10 years, you will make a different business decision than if it is, ‘Might be 100%, not sure what's going to be in three months, what's it going to be in a year from now, and what's it going to be in three years from now.’ That uncertainty does not create stable markets. It does not create very accurate business decisions.",

      "full_content": "Two different teams of astronomers have detected oxygen in the most distant known galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0. The discovery, reported in two separate studies, was made possible thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. This record-breaking detection is making astronomers rethink how quickly galaxies formed in the early Universe. Discovered last year, JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant confirmed galaxy ever found: it is so far away, its light took 13.4 billion years to reach us, meaning we see it as it was when the Universe was less than 300 million years old, about 2% of its present age. The new oxygen detection with ALMA, a telescope array in Chile’s Atacama Desert, suggests the galaxy is much more chemically mature than expected. “It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies,” says Sander Schouws, a PhD candidate at Leiden Observatory, the Netherlands, and first author of the Dutch-led study, now accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. “The results show the galaxy has formed very rapidly and is also maturing rapidly, adding to a growing body of evidence that the formation of galaxies happens much faster than was expected.\"  Galaxies usually start their lives full of young stars, which are made mostly of light elements like hydrogen and helium. As stars evolve, they create heavier elements like oxygen, which get dispersed through their host galaxy after they die. Researchers had thought that, at 300 million years old, the Universe was still too young to have galaxies ripe with heavy elements. However, the two ALMA studies indicate JADES-GS-z14-0 has about 10 times more heavy elements than expected. “I was astonished by the unexpected results because they opened a new view on the first phases of galaxy evolution,” says Stefano Carniani, of the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa, Italy, and lead author on the paper now accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. “The evidence that a galaxy is already mature in the infant Universe raises questions about when and how galaxies formed.” The oxygen detection has also allowed astronomers to make their distance measurements to JADES-GS-z14-0 much more accurate. “The ALMA detection offers an extraordinarily precise measurement of the galaxy’s distance down to an uncertainty of just 0.005 percent. This level of precision — analogous to being accurate within 5 cm over a distance of 1 km — helps refine our understanding of distant galaxy properties,” adds Eleonora Parlanti, a PhD student at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and author on the Astronomy & Astrophysics study [1]. “While the galaxy was originally discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, it took ALMA to confirm and precisely determine its enormous distance,” [2] says Associate Professor Rychard Bouwens, a member of the team at Leiden Observatory. “This shows the amazing synergy between ALMA and JWST to reveal the formation and evolution of the first galaxies.” Gergö Popping, an ESO astronomer at the European ALMA Regional Centre who did not take part in the studies, says: \"I was really surprised by this clear detection of oxygen in JADES-GS-z14-0. It suggests galaxies can form more rapidly after the Big Bang than had previously been thought. This result showcases the important role ALMA plays in unraveling the conditions under which the first galaxies in our Universe formed.\" [1] Astronomers use a measurement known as redshift to determine the distance to extremely distant objects. Previous measurements indicated that the galaxy JADES-GS-z-14-0 was at a redshift between about 14.12 and 14.4. With their oxygen detections, both teams have now narrowed this down to a redshift around 14.18.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomy facility, is a partnership of ESO, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) of Japan in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. ALMA is funded by ESO on behalf of its Member States, by NSF in cooperation with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in Taiwan and by NINS in cooperation with the Academia Sinica (AS) in Taiwan and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI). ALMA construction and operations are led by ESO on behalf of its Member States; by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), managed by Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), on behalf of North America; and by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) on behalf of East Asia. The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) provides the unified leadership and management of the construction, commissioning and operation of ALMA.  The European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to discover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground — which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy — and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO’s headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world’s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky” — ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.  \nStefano Carniani\nScuola Normale Superiore\nPisa, Italy\nTel: +39 050 509156\n\nEmail: stefano.carniani@sns.it \nSander Schouws\nLeiden University\nLeiden, The Netherlands\n\n\nEmail: sanderschouws@gmail.com \nEleonora Parlanti\nScuola Normale Superiore\nPisa, Italy\n\n\nEmail: eleonora.parlanti@sns.it \nRychard Bouwens\nLeiden Observatory, University of Leiden\nLeiden, The Netherlands\nTel: +31 71 527 8456\n\nEmail: bouwens@strw.leidenuniv.nl \nJacqueline Hodge\nLeiden Observatory, University of Leiden\nLeiden, The Netherlands\nTel: +31 71 527 8450\n\nEmail: hodge@strw.leidenuniv.nl \nGergö Popping\nEuropean ALMA Regional Centre, European Southern Observatory\n\nTel: +49 89 3200 6247\n\nEmail: gpopping@eso.org \nBárbara Ferreira\nESO Media Manager\nGarching bei München, Germany\nTel: +49 89 3200 6670\nCell: +49 151 241 664 00\nEmail: press@eso.org We use cookies that are essential for accessing our websites and using our services.

      "full_content": "TSMC’s first US chip plant took significantly longer to build and begin production than was forecast, but the company says that future plants will proceed at a significantly faster pace. This will enable US-made chips for somewhat newer Apple devices. But former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is dismissive of the initiative, suggesting that it will be of little help in enabling the US to be a global player in the chip business …  Regular readers will be familiar with the story so far.  Apple first announced its plan for ‘Made in America’ chips back in 2022, with the news hailed as one of the success stories of the US CHIPS Act. The initiative will see a series of TSMC chipmaking plants built in Arizona, with some of the production reserved for Apple chips for older devices. The project has been beset with delays and uncertainties. Mass production at the first plant was due to start last year and was then pushed back to this year. Questions were raised about the promised US jobs, with many employees recruited from Taiwan, and the company even being accused of “anti-American discrimination.” Skepticism was also voiced about the recent announcement of an additional $100B investment. The first TSMC plant is only capable of making larger process chips used in older Apple devices. This includes the A16 chip first developed for the iPhone 14 Pro, which is no longer made, and the base model iPhone 15 models, which are still available from Apple but likely sell in small volumes. If it takes years to bring a new US plant online, that would mean US-made Apple chips would forever be relegated to significantly older devices. However, Nikkei Asia reports that TSMC has promised investors that the sluggish pace seen with the development of its first US plant will not be repeated. While that first plant took five years to build and open, the company says that future US plants will take no more than two. That will see a 3nm plant brought online in 2028, and a 2nm one “before 2030.” The US plants will still lag behind the cutting-edge ones in Taiwan, meaning they will never make chips for the latest Apple products, but will at least close the gap. Given that TSMC’s advanced chipmaking capabilities far outstripped those of US rival Intel, it’s no surprise that the two companies haven’t exactly been best buddies. After Apple made the switch from Intel Macs to Apple Silicon ones, the US chipmaker insisted it could catch up or even win back the business. Even after being forced out of the company for failing to deliver, ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger remains dismissive of TSMC’s US plants. The Financial Times reports him saying it will do little to advance US chipmaking. “If you don’t have R&D in the US, you will not have semiconductor leadership in the US,” Gelsinger said. “All of the R&D work of TSMC is in Taiwan, and they haven’t made any announcements to move that.” Given that TSMC sees its home base in Taiwan as key to protecting the secrecy of its most advanced tech, it’s exceedingly unlikely the company would ever move any significant R&D work to the US.

      "full_content": "Dutch architecture studio MVRDV has introduced its vision for Market Cube, a versatile marketplace made up of stacked volumes in Zhubei, Taiwan. This innovative design by MVRDV reimagines the traditional market square, featuring a tiered structure intended to offer flexibility and adapt to future shifts in market-building typology. “With its stack of open, flexible floors that can adapt to changing demands, the building acts as an urban condenser and is envisaged as the next step in the evolution of the market,” the studio said. “This future-focused vision is reflected in its name: the market square becomes the Market Cube.” Designer: MVRDV \n\n\n\n\n  The Market Cube will span eight floors and cover 18,962 square meters, featuring two levels dedicated to market space and food courts, as well as exhibition areas, a daycare and children’s center, and a rooftop performance venue. Multi-level underground parking will also be included. The building’s design allows each level to be independently opened to the exterior or closed off, enabling some areas to remain accessible at night. Visualizations of the proposal show expansive external terraces that function as walkways on each level, accessed via two sets of escalators encased in translucent panels. On the first floor, a pedestrian bridge will connect over the adjacent road, providing direct access from the nearby park to the food court. The market spaces on the ground and lower levels will extend into the surrounding streets, integrating the building with its urban environment. \n\n\n\n\n  Inside Market Cube, a diverse array of vendors will be accommodated, ranging from traditional market stalls offering local goods and produce to modern kiosks equipped with built-in seating areas for a more relaxed shopping or dining experience. The interiors are thoughtfully designed with spacious, flexible layouts that can be easily adapted to suit “any alternative use imaginable,” ensuring that the space can evolve with changing needs and trends. High ceilings further enhance the sense of openness, allowing for creative installations or temporary exhibits that can transform the space as needed. To facilitate easy navigation throughout the Market Cube, each level will be illuminated with a distinct color scheme, which will add visual interest and also serve as a guide to the building’s various functions. This color-coding system is designed to intuitively communicate the purpose of each area to visitors, enhancing their overall experience. Strategically placed LED screens will provide information and updates, while neon lights contribute a modern, vibrant aesthetic. Together, these elements create an engaging and dynamic environment that reflects the innovative spirit of the Market Cube.

      "full_content": "The duties would still mark a significant escalation of U.S. tariffs. President Donald Trump’s plan for reciprocal tariffs on April 2 is expected to be more targeted and narrower than what the president has vowed in the past, but the plan is still under discussion, sources told ABC News. The fresh round of duties, however, would still mark a significant escalation for the U.S. and its trading partners. In February, Trump ordered federal agencies to look into virtually every U.S. trading partner in evaluating what reciprocal tariff rate to put on them. “April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol’ USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!” Trump’s officials have been signaling a more conciliatory tone in recent interviews. “One of the things we see from markets is they’re expecting ... these really large tariffs on every single country,” Kevin Hassett, Trump’s National Economic Council director, said on Fox News. “I think markets need to change their expectations, because it’s not everybody that cheats us on trade, it’s just a few countries and those countries are going to be seeing some tariffs.” The administration is focused on trading partners who have major trade imbalances with the U.S., the sources said. “It’s 15% of the countries, but it’s a huge amount of our trading volume,” U.S. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent said last week. Last year, according to federal census data, the U.S. had the biggest trade deficits with China, the EU, Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Thailand, Switzerland, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and South Africa. Bloomberg previously reported on the altered plans for tariffs. The Trump administration will likely forego sector-specific tariffs on autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors that were also previously planned for April 2, The Wall Street Journal reported. U.S. stocks surged on Monday on the news of narrower tariff plans. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 500 points, or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 jumped 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq increased more than 2%. In recent weeks, Trump's tariffs have roiled markets, stoked recession concerns and heightened worries about inflation. In short order, Trump has paused or reversed some tariffs, casting doubt over his plans and adding to the uncertainty, experts previously told ABC News. The Trump administration earlier this month slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, though the White House soon imposed a one-month delay for some of those tariffs. A fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China a month prior. Tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum on March 12 triggered retaliatory tariffs from Canada and the European Union, adding to countermeasures already initiated by China. Economists widely expect tariffs to increase inflation, since exporters typically pass along a share of the tax to consumers in the form of price hikes. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said Trump’s tariffs are partly to blame for price increases, leveling the criticism minutes after the central bank announced its decision to hold interest rates steady. Even as the Fed left its main policy lever unchanged, the central bank predicted weaker year-end economic growth and higher inflation than it had in a December forecast.

Hawkins If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Smartphone apps that track our driving behavior may be the key to safer road conditions.  The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety just published a study that found that using smartphone apps to monitor driver behavior, and then providing summaries of that behavior via text message or a data dashboard, leads to safer driving.  Researchers borrowed techniques from usage-based insurance (UBI) programs, in which insurance companies use smartphone apps to measure dangerous driving behaviors, like hard braking, sudden acceleration, and speeding. Rather than rely on actuarial data, like driving records and vehicle type, UBI programs use real-time data from app trackers to determine premiums. These are typically opt-in programs, marketed as a way to lower premiums. But if your driving isn’t as safe as you think, it can lead to higher monthly payments.  Most people have an aversion to being tracked in real-time by their insurance company. But the AAA group was able to show that these methods can lead to safer driving — even after the tracking apps are turned off. Participants were told their data was being reviewed as part of a research study, and not being used by insurance companies to lower or raise their rates.  Most people have an aversion to being tracked in real-time by their insurance company. The research team corralled 1,400 participants and split them into four groups: a control group; a standard feedback group, which were given weekly feedback via text on all behaviors monitored; an assigned goal group, which were given weekly text feedback on one behavior; and a chosen goal group, which selected their own behavior on which to receive feedback.  Among the three feedback groups, 13 percent of participants showed a reduction in speeding, 21 percent showed a reduction in hard braking, and 25 percent experienced less rapid acceleration.  Participants also gave their own feedback on tactics for changing their driving behavior: 67.4 percent said they would be persuaded by the potential to earn extra money; 53.9 percent liked weekly feedback via text message; and 45.8 percent preferred a weekly dashboard that provided detailed driving information for the week.  The research team also monitored the groups’ use of smartphones while driving, and were surprised to find that terrible behavior remained mostly unchanged. They theorized that providing baseline safety scores at the start of the study led drivers to believe they were being safer than they actually were — and therefore, less in need for improvement.  13 percent of participants showed a reduction in speeding After the 12-week study, participants were monitored for an additional six weeks without any feedback to determine whether their improved driving would persist. The study found that generally they continued to drive more safely.  “It’s encouraging to see that many individuals stuck with safer habits even after the study,” said Jake Nelson, AAA’s director of traffic safety advocacy, in a statement. “This shows that positive reinforcement, not just punitive measures, can lead to safer driving habits that can save lives.” In 2023, over 40,000 people died in vehicle crashes in the US. AAA says the research results point to the need for innovative approaches to educating people about safer driving behavior.  Most people have an aversion to being tracked while they drive — especially when you consider that most drivers have an overinflated sense of their own behavior. But UBI programs are growing. In 2020, 16 percent of auto insurance shoppers were offered UBI and 12 percent of them enrolled, according to USA Today. In 2024, 15 percent of buyers were offered UBI, but a almost a fifth of them signed up. We already use our phones to monitor a lot of our behavior, including our steps, our sleep, and our eating habits. Why not driving?

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump has dubiously claimed he wants to be the champion of America’s working class, but his new trade policies seem more likely to kill small businesses and put plenty of working men and women out of a job. Indeed, Trump’s tariff policies aren’t just terrifying Wall Street. They’re also freaking out small business owners, as can be seen by a sudden glut of comments on Reddit’s r/smallbusiness subreddit. There, small business owners can be seen fretting over everything from skyrocketing import duties to the increased costs that they will have to pass on to their customers. One apparent business owner who recently ordered aluminum parts from China expressed amazement at the sudden escalation in import fees. User “eopcido” wrote: We have a small business and ordered $3,380 worth of aluminum parts from China. Parts entered USA on 3/31/25. DHL requires $2,483.21 for “import duty” or they will send back the parts 5 days…Can this be right? A commenter explained the newly added costs to the business owner: “You can expect to add 34% to all future orders, with the possibility of an additional 50% increase after this week. This brings the total potential increase to 156.5%.” “In case everyone hasn’t figured it out yet, Trump and Co don’t want us buying anything from China anymore,” another commenter noted. Another Redditor, who said that they own a retail store, explained how the expected import prices could totally upend their business: “We are looking at anywhere from 20%-60%,” they said, apparently referencing price increases. “That will absolutely destroy my business. Im super worried.” Keep in mind, these comments were coming before China added an additional 84 percent tariff on Tuesday night. Background-pickle389, said that their bamboo clothing business would “likely have to close” due to the exponential increase in costs spurred by the tariffs: Does anyone have any American based manufacturers? I’m devastated that all my hard work is going to be pulled out from underneath. I just hit my 10,000 order last week and don’t know what to do now. My shop is too small to absorb the cost of it all, but I know raising prices isn’t feasible since our cost of living is about to go astronomically high. Another user, Coachellahopefull, explained their own predicament with a European import business they’d built up: My uncle owns a pottery studio in Poland, my mom and I have been wholesaling the product here in the US for the last 20 years. We’ve been holding our breath waiting to see what the tariffs were going to be. It looks like it’s going to be 20% for European products. We have 2 containers on the way to the US right now, 50% of the product already is sold and we cannot change the pricing on it. This will be so detrimental to our company and I just don’t know what we should do. Many users have discussed adding “tariff charge” line items to their receipts so that customers understand the increased prices are a result of the Trump administration’s economic policies, not random price gouging. On one small business owner’s thread, a commenter said: “Let people know it’s tariffs that are at fault for your higher prices. If it’s true, it passes some of the blame from you to the administration, which can help change things. A lot of people don’t watch the news, and they should know that it’s directly affecting them.” One misinformed user made the unfortunate decision to create a post asking fellow r/smallbusiness Redditors whether they thought Trump’s tariffs would “help small business owners.” The retribution was ruthless and swift. “LOL,” one user posted. “LMFAO.” “This is a dumb fucking question,” another chimed in. “It will definitely help some businesses,” another added. “Mainly bankruptcy lawyers and undertakers.” \nChinaDonald TrumpReddit  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          It's the Art of the Deal.\n         \n          The destruction of the Trump regime will be felt for generations.\n         \n          If the White House has an authoritarian toolkit to use on civil protesters, you can thank Biden for it.\n         \n          Tesla's factory in Shanghai only produces the carmaker's more affordable models, with the Model S and X imported from the U.S.\n         \n          A senior official describes the billionaire as an awkward and obnoxious asshole.\n         \n          On again, off again.",

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump's slew of broad tariffs target dozens of countries, including many key US trading partners. A range of goods Americans rely on will be affected. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to implement broad tariffs on over 180 countries that have placed tariffs on US goods. On top of a 10% baseline tariff, the president said he'll impose additional double-digit tariffs that the administration argued were based on tariffs and other trade barriers those countries placed on the US. \"They do it to us, and we do it to them. Very simple. Can't get any simpler than that,\" Trump said during his remarks. Some affected countries have already warned of retaliatory tariffs following Trump's announcement; Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said during a speech ahead of Trump's executive order that \"we do not necessarily want to retaliate but, if it is necessary, we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it.\" Here are the top goods the US imports from some of the major countries hit by Trump's newest tariffs. Trump announced a 34% tariff on goods imported from China in addition to the earlier 20% tariff he placed on them last month. The US imported $438.9 billion worth of goods from China in 2024. Census Bureau data showed that radio and television broadcasting and wireless communications equipment were major imports from China in 2024. Computers, apparel, and footwear were among the top goods imported based on dollar value. Trump announced a 20% tariff on goods imported from the European Union. The US imported $605.8 billion worth of goods from the EU in 2024. Some of the key imports from the EU based on 2024 data involve healthcare-related goods, including pharmaceutical preparations. Trump announced a 46% tariff on goods imported from Vietnam. The US imported about $136.6 billion worth of goods from the country in 2024. The top 10 imports from Vietnam in 2024 based on dollar value included computer-related and other equipment, furniture, and semiconductors. Trump announced a 32% tariff on goods imported from Taiwan. The US imported about $116.3 billion worth of goods from the country in 2024. The top 10 imports from Taiwan in 2024 included various kinds of electronic and computer equipment, fasteners, and semiconductors.  Trump announced a 24% tariff on goods imported from Japan. The US imported $148.2 billion worth of goods from the country in 2024. Vehicles, vehicle parts, and motors were among the top 10 goods imported from Japan in 2024.",

      "full_content": "Most semiconductors, the silicon microchips that run everything from TV remote controls to humanoid robots are exempt from the slew of tariffs rolled out by the Trump administration last week. But that's not the end of the story for the industry which also powers the immense shift in computing toward artificial intelligence that's already underway, led by the US. There are roughly $45 billion worth of semiconductors (based on 2024 totals gathered by Bernstein), that remain tariff-free — $12 billion of which comes from Taiwan, where AI chip leader Nvidia manufactures. But, the AI ecosystem requires much more than chips alone. Data centers and the myriad materials and components required to generate depictions of everyone as an anime character are not exempt. For instance, an imported remote-controlled toy car with chips in both components would need an exception for toys, to avoid fees. \"We still have more questions than answers about this,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a note sent to investors Thursday morning. \"Semiconductors are exempt. But what about modules? Cards?\" As of Friday morning, analysts were still scratching their heads as to the impact, despite the exemption. \"We're not exactly sure what to do with all this,\" wrote Bernstein's analysts. \"Most semiconductors enter the US inside other things for which tariffs are likely to have a much bigger influence, hence secondary effects are likely to be far more material.\" Nvidia designs chips and software, but what it mainly sells are boards, according to Dylan Patel, chief analyst at Semianalysis. Boards contain multiple chips, but also power delivery controls, and other components to make them work. \"On the surface, the exemption does not exempt Nvidia shipments as they ship GPU board assemblies,\" Patel told Business Insider. \"If accelerator boards are excluded in addition to semiconductors, then the cost would not go up much,\" he continued. These boards are just the beginning of the bumper crop of AI data centers in the works right now. Server racks, steel cabinets, and all the cabling, cooling gear, and switches to manage data flow and power are mostly imported. A spokesperson for AMD, which, like Nvidia, produces its AI chips in Taiwan, told BI the company is closely monitoring the regulations. \"Although semiconductors are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, we are assessing the details and any impacts on our broader customer and partner ecosystem,\" the spokesperson said in an email statement. Nvidia declined to comment on the implications of the tariffs. But CEO Jensen Huang got the question from financial analysts last month at the company's annual GTC conference. \"We're preparing and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore,\" he said. Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC has invested $100 billion in a manufacturing facility in Arizona. \"We are now running production silicon in Arizona. And so, we will manufacture onshore. The rest of the systems, we'll manufacture as much onshore as we need to,\" Huang said. \"We have a super agile supply chain, we're manufacturing in so many different places, we could shift things,\" he continued. In addition to potentially producing chips in the US, it's plausible that companies, including Nvidia, could do more of their final assembly in the US, Chris Miller, the author of \"Chip War\" and a leading expert on the semiconductor industry told BI. Moving the later steps of the manufacturing process to un-tariffed shores, which right now include Canada and Mexico as well as the US, could theoretically allow these companies to import bare silicon chips and avoid levies. But that change would come with a cost as well, Miller said. With retaliatory tariffs rolling in, US manufacturers could find tariffs weighing down demand in international markets too. Semiconductor industry veteran Sachin Gandhi just brought his startup Retym out of stealth mode last week, with a semiconductor that helps data move between data centers faster. Technology like his has been most relevant to the telecom industry for decades and is now finding new markets in AI data centers. Retym's finished product is exempt from tariffs when it enters the US, but the semiconductor supply chain is complex. Products often cross borders while being manufactured in multiple steps, packaged, tested, and validated, and then shipped to the final destination. A global tariff-rich environment will probably bring up his costs in one way or another, Gandhi told BI. End customers like hyperscalers and the ecosystem of middlemen who bundle all these elements together and sell them will figure out how to cover these costs without too much consternation to a point, he said. \"Demand is not particularly price sensitive,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore Thursday. AI is already an area where companies appear willing to spend with abandon. But, it's also maturing. Now, when companies are working to put together realistic estimates for normal business metrics like return on investment, unit economics, and profitability, tariffs risk pushing that down the road, potentially years.

      "full_content": "The Google Pixel 9a launched on Mar. 19, and we were taken by surprise when the tech giant didn't give us information on preorders or in-store launch dates. Now, ten days later, the company announced that the budget phones will be out in stores starting April 10. Google usually makes all its devices available for pre-orders on launch day, but for the Pixel 9a, we were told that it would show up in stores \"sometime in April\" without a concrete date. There's a good reason why Google wanted to hold back preorders; it said the first Pixel 9a units had a \"component quality issue\" and that it wanted to make sure that the phone was functioning as it was supposed to before being released to the masses.  In a community post, the company detailed its rollout plan, starting with users in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., who will get to buy the Pixel 9a as early as April 10, while folks in European countries will be able to get the device on April 14. As for Australia, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia — they will see the budget phone in store on April 16. Google also states that the Pixel 9a will be \"coming soon\" to Japan; however, a specific date hasn't been confirmed yet. The tech giant added that the \"Pixel 9a will be available at the Google Store and through our retail partners beginning in April, and you can sign up today to get notified as soon as it's available.\"  Debuting at $499 in two new colorways: Iris and Peony, the Pixel 9a comes with the fastest Tensor G4 chip, gets up to 30 plus hours of battery life, and can do almost everything that the standard Pixel 9 phone can. Right off the bat, the Pixel 9a sports an all-new look, ditching its usual pill-shaped camera bump and housing the rear cameras within the phone. For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen. Like the other Pixel 9 devices, this budget phone also gets Android 15 out of the box and seven years of OS and security updates. The phone comes with all the latest AI features, including Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor, and more. Lastly, Google didn't mention when users can start pre-ordering the Pixel 9a, but anyone interested can hit the \"get notified\" button on the Google Store to be the first to know when the phone will be available online.

      "full_content": "If you've been following iPhone rumors over the last few years, you may remember reading reports that Apple flirted with the idea of introducing a super high-end \"Ultra\" model that would either replace its Pro Max device or sit above it in Apple's smartphone hirearchy. These reports appeared in the pre-launch iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, but ultimately came to nothing. Now though, the rumor is back.  Citing sources from Weibo, Taiwan, \"US investment report content,\" and supply chain trends, the Korean news aggregator account \"yeux1122\" on the Naver blog has summarized \"rumors regarding Apple's iPhone 17 Ultra name change.\" The blog begins by highlighting the following rumored changes that have so far been attributed to various models in the upcoming iPhone 17 series: Analyst Jeff Pu in October said that the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max will have a narrower Dynamic Island, but the claim has since been disputed by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Nevertheless, the Naver blog claims that, based on component orders for a smaller Dynamic Island, the supply volume is \"insufficient\" to cover both iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, intimating that only the larger \"Ultra\" device will feature one.    The Naver blog also asserts that only the \"Ultra\" device will feature a vapor chamber cooling system, despite competing rumors claiming that it will come either to both Pro models or all iPhone 17 models.  Lastly, the blog claims that the \"Ultra\" model will be thicker than the iPhone 17 Pro, owing to a larger battery. This rumor is the only one that we know of that has only been tied to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. If it was exhaustive, the blog could have also pointed to the 12GB of RAM that Kuo in August said would be coming to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. However, Pu has pushed back on this prediction and believes that both Pro models will get 12GB, up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro models. It could also have included Kuo's prediction last year that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be the first iPhone to feature three 48MP cameras, although that claim has since been challenged by a Chinese leaker.\n As a result of changes allegedly destined for Apple's largest high-end model, the blog claims that this year's iPhone 17 lineup will look like so: This differentiation strategy would arguably help Apple justify a higher price point for an \"Ultra\" iPhone model with more advanced features. And let's not forget that Apple already has an established naming convention where \"Air,\" \"Pro,\" and \"Ultra\" denote distinct tiers across various product categories. For instance, the MacBook Air and iPad Air represent lightweight, consumer-friendly options, while \"Pro\" models cater to professional users seeking enhanced performance. The \"Ultra\" designation introduced with products like the Apple Watch Ultra signifies a top-tier offering with better capabilities. And then there's the most powerful Apple silicon chip to date – the M3 Ultra. Whether Apple adopts the Ultra moniker for its most premium iPhone 17 model remains to be seen, but we do know that Apple has internally discussed the possibility for previous generations. Barring further corroboration from trusted sources, we'll have to wait and see when the iPhone 17 lineup launches later this year around Apple's usual mid-September time frame.",

      "full_content": "Kevin Bates says his gadget business was a “miracle of global trade,” one that is now going away. Kevin Bates says his gadget business was a “miracle of global trade,” one that is now going away. by  Sean Hollister Kevin Bates managed to quit his day job and move to China after his game-playing business card, the Arduboy, went viral in 2014. But a decade later, Trump’s staggering and inexplicable new US tariffs are driving him out of business. Just as he was about to turn a profit for the first time, just before he was about to bring a new product to retail, he tells The Verge that his company can no longer survive as-is. He says that despite lifetime Arduboy sales of over $1 million, much of it from recent growth in 2023 and 2024, Trump’s new 104 percent China tariffs will be the beginning of the end. “I just like making circuit boards and helping people learn to code games. This is all too much,” he says. Even if he wanted to — Bates admits he’s been looking to sunset Arduboy for a while — he says he wouldn’t be able to satisfy Trump’s stated goal of restarting manufacturing in the US. “There are no manufacturers in the USA who would even answer an email to produce Arduboy, much less give a good price. I could build them myself and end up making about $10 an hour, still paying a crazy amount for components.” Instead, he says, his options are to dramatically raise prices, find a way around the tariffs, or simply kill off Arduboy for good. “The fact Arduboy could exist at all was kind of a miracle of global trade. An individual person, producing and distributing an international product with margins that would never work at a larger company. I didn’t need 80 percent markup to survive,” he says, adding that his actual margins ranged from 30 to 50 percent. Trump’s US tariffs would entirely wipe out those margins, and he says China’s retaliatory tariffs would hurt too, as they would impose a 34 percent tariff on the Arduboy’s US-made processor, which Bates says is the most expensive component in the system. While he’s hopeful that some larger organization might buy Arduboy and take up the torch, he admits that’s not terribly realistic in this economic climate, and he’s already declaring Arduboy “dead” on his LinkedIn and in the Arduboy forums. He’s already looking for a new day job once again. But he says Arduboy isn’t quite dead yet. He wants to launch one last Kickstarter for a USB-C version of the Arduboy with “more features like real time clock, IR blaster, and link cable support,” assuming he can figure out how to ship them at a price people will pay. He says he already saw $99 Arduboy FX Special Edition as overpriced for what it is, and he isn’t looking forward to charging $200 for a new version or saddling buyers with customs fees should he choose to drop-ship them. “The only realistic solution is to warehouse the inventory somewhere that doesn’t have Chinese import taxes, and drop ship everything. I visited my factory last year to talk about this, and they said all their customers are in the same situation so they said they would have a solution. But one has not materialized yet,” he says. Speaking of drop-shipping and customs fees, that is probably what you should expect if you buy the new banana-shaped Arduboy or the last few remaining units of the Arduboy FX Special Edition. “I am planning to fulfill the orders but they may be drop shipped, so U.S. customers should be aware that import taxes may now apply,” he tells The Verge. But he also may just turn off Banana-Bit preorders, as he says he’s only sold about a dozen so far. He also warns these packages could get held up at US customs for a time, because Trump has also gotten rid of the de minimis exemption that let low-value packages enter the US duty-free. “That’s going to impact everything from Shein to Temu to AliExpress, and honestly, it’s going to be chaos. U.S. customs isn’t ready for that volume,” he says. Bates says Trump’s trade war is “an absolute unmitigated disaster for anyone without the ability to dramatically restructure.” “I guess that’s the point,” he adds.

      "full_content": "Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration and Ministry of Public Security has outlawed the use of facial recognition without consent. The two orgs last Friday published new rules on facial recognition and an explainer that spell out how orgs that want to use facial recognition must first conduct a “personal information protection impact assessment” that considers whether using the tech is necessary, impacts on individuals’ privacy, and risks of data leakage. Organizations that decide to use facial recognition must data encrypt biometric data, and audit the information security techniques and practices they use to protect facial scans. Chinese that go through that process and decide they want to use facial recognition can only do so after securing individuals’ consent. The rules also ban the use of facial recognition equipment in public places such as hotel rooms, public bathrooms, public dressing rooms, and public toilets. The measures don’t apply to researchers or to what machine translation of the rules describes as “algorithm training activities” – suggesting images of citizens’ faces are fair game when used to train AI models. The documents linked to above don’t mention whether government agencies are exempt from the new rules. The Register fancies Beijing will keep using facial recognition whenever it wants to as its previously expressed interest in a national identity scheme that uses the tech, and used it to identify members of ethnic minorities. Zoho has won the competition to create a made-in-India web browser that the nation’s government will champion as ideal for local users. India’s government launched the Web Browser Development Challenge in 2023 and called for competitors to develop apps that use a root certificate issued by the nation’s Controller of Certifying Authorities so local users would not be dependent on certificates issued by entities controlled by other government. Zoho’s Ulaa browser won the competition the company won ₹1 Crore ($115,000) to ensure its compatibility with iOS, Windows, and Android. Two startups, Team PING and Team Ajna, were named as first and second runners up. India’s government hasn’t outlined a plan to have device-makers adopt the browsers, which may be hard to achieve as the nation’s dominant mobile carrier Jio is so close to Google that the two collaborated on a custom version of Android for low cost home brand handsets. Cisco’s Talos threat-hunters last week reported attacks on critical infrastructure in Taiwan, including telecommunications, healthcare, and information technology operations, by a crew that uses similar tactics to those employed by the probably-China-backed Volt Typhoon and Flax Typhoon crews. Talos named the group “UAT-5918” and assessed it as “motivated by establishing long-term access for information theft, uses a combination of web shells and open-sourced tooling to conduct post-compromise activities to establish persistence in victim environments for information theft and credential harvesting.” UAT-5918 often gains access by exploiting a known, and unpatched, vulnerability. Once it compromises and org, it moves laterally and looks for juicy info to exfiltrate. Elon Musk’s social network X has reportedly sued the government of India over laws that allow content takedowns. India has argued it needs laws to take down content that could threaten national security, but its government has sometimes decided that posts about mass protests against its policies should be taken down. X’s court filing, seen by Reuters, aims to fight India’s laws on grounds they violate freedom of speech. Japan’s government last week tabled a new cybersecurity bill that will shift the nation to an “active defense” stance – including offensive operations against offshore targets felt to represent a threat to national security. Digital Minister Masaaki Taira said the law follows international norms. The bill faces opposition at home as it allows Japan’s government to obtain info from operators of critical infrastructure such as electricity and railways to obtain communications information to monitor for potential cyberattacks. Minister Taira assured Japan’s parliament personal information is not the target, and assured lawmakers that the bill includes safeguards that will preserve privacy. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a think tank founded and funded by Australia’s government, last week claimed it had become the target of Chinese trolls after publishing research critical of the Middle Kingdom. “Staff have been threatened, harassed & abused, with female staff targeted most viciously. Most of the claims made in Chinese state media are false, including that ASPI has halted its China research,” wrote ASPI executive director Justin Bassi. ® Send us news",

      "full_content": "The Chinese military officials in brown uniforms fan out around rows of young trees, shoveling soil into freshly dug pits. The camera pans to the most senior leaders one by one, in order of rank. But one prominent face is conspicuously absent.\n     \n            The news segment, aired Wednesday night on China’s state broadcaster, features a tree-planting event in the outskirts of the capital Beijing – an annual springtime tradition for the country’s military leadership spanning more than four decades.\n     \n            But Gen. He Weidong, the second-highest-ranking uniformed officer in the People’s Liberation Army, was nowhere to be seen. Nor was he named as a participant in a report by the official state news agency.\n     \n            Gen. He’s absence from the high-profile event has fueled ongoing speculation that the second-ranking vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) may have become the latest – and most senior – casualty in leader Xi Jinping’s purge of the military’s top ranks.\n     \n            As Xi’s No.2 general, He shares a long-standing relationship with the Chinese leader, dating back decades to the early days of their careers in the coastal province of Fujian.\n     \n            Rumors about an investigation against He first surfaced among the Chinese dissident community following China’s annual political meetings last month. The 67-year-old hasn’t appeared in public for three weeks since the closing ceremony of the country’s rubber-stamp legislature on March 11.\n     \n            The Chinese government has offered little in the way of clearing the air.\n     \n            When asked about He’s situation at a news briefing on March 27, Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said: “There is no information on this matter, and we are not aware of the situation.”\n     \n            It is now unclear what has happened to He, who also sits on the Communist Party’s 24-member Politburo.\n     \n            Three weeks out of the public eye is not unheard of for a top general without a public-facing role and there is always a chance he resurfaces. But his no-show at a well-choreographed annual propaganda event stands out in a political system deeply attuned to the importance of symbolism.\n     \n            “Clearly the absence of one CMC vice chair is important symbolically,” said James Char, a longtime PLA expert and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n     \n            Similar to the Communist Party Congresses and annual “two sessions” political gatherings, “it’s important for all the major figures that the rest of the world know of to show up to be in the same picture, because it helps to demonstrate the power and – more importantly – the unity of the party,” Char said.\n     \n            In the opaque world of Chinese politics, observers have long leaned on arcane signals of Communist Party traditions and protocol to interpret what is going on behind the scenes. The discipline, known as “tea-leaf reading,” has become more relevant than ever in Xi’s era as he centralizes power into his own hands and makes the decision-making process even more obscure.\n     \n            And now, some experts are scouring this week’s events for clues on the fate of one of Xi’s top generals.\n     \n            The annual ritual began as part of a nationwide tree-planting campaign launched by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in late 1981, following devastating floods he blamed on rampant deforestation. It was billed as a patriotic, selfless undertaking in “greening the motherland, building socialism and benefiting future generations.”\n     \n            The following spring, Deng, then chairman of the CMC, planted the first tree of the campaign, setting a tradition that has since been carried on by successive Chinese leaders and military top brass.\n     \n            Wednesday marked “the 43rd consecutive year the CMC leadership has collectively participated in the voluntary tree-planting activity in the capital,” said Xinhua, the state news agency.\n     \nRelated article\nXi brought down powerful rivals in the military. Now he’s going after his own men\n \n            Since Xi came to power in late 2012, his two vice chairmen on the CMC had led military officers to plant trees without fail every spring – until He’s rare absence on Wednesday.\n     \n            The first-ranking CMC vice chairman, Gen. Zhang Youxia, attended the event, so did two other generals on the commission, Liu Zhenli and Zhang Shengmin.\n     \n            The only other uniformed CMC member who did not show up was Adm. Miao Hua, who was suspended under investigation in November for “serious violations of discipline” – a common euphemism for corruption and disloyalty.\n     \n            “I think He’s absence is quite telling, but again, no one can be absolutely sure,” Char said. “There’s another school of thought, which is He Weidong was involved in the last two weeks with the preparations for the military exercises around Taiwan.”\n     \n            Starting from Tuesday, combined forces of the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command held surprise exercises around Taiwan for two straight days, testing capabilities to blockade the self-ruling island, simulate strikes on its ports and other critical infrastructure, and launch long-range live-fire strikes.\n     \n            The commander of the Eastern Theater Command from 2019 to 2022 was He. It was during his tenure that the Eastern Theater Command staged massive military drills and fired missiles around Taiwan in August 2022, in retaliation against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.\n     \n            A prolonged absence from public view does not always signal trouble for Chinese officials. Some have resurfaced and resumed their duties. It’s also not uncommon for officials to be taken in for questioning by graft busters to assist investigations into colleagues.\n     \n            Last November, Defense Minister Dong Jun was reported to be under investigation for corruption by the Financial Times, citing US officials. China’s Defense Ministry dismissed the report as a “sheer fabrication.” Dong reemerged in public a week later. The minister was also seen attending Wednesday’s tree-planting event on the state broadcaster.\n     \n            After coming to power, Xi consolidated control over the world’s largest military by taking down powerful generals from rival factions and replacing them with allies and loyal proteges.\n     \n            But a decade on, having structurally overhauled the People’s Liberation Army and stacked its top ranks with his own men, Xi is still knee-deep in his seemingly endless struggle against graft and disloyalty – and is increasingly turning against his own handpicked loyalists.\n     \n            Since the summer of 2023, more than a dozen high-ranking figures in China’s defense establishment have been ousted in a sweeping purge that focused on the country’s nuclear force and equipment procurement, including two defense ministers promoted to the CMC by Xi.\n     \n            The ongoing turmoil roiling the senior ranks of the PLA has raised questions over Xi’s ability to end systemic corruption in the military and enhance its combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions.\n     \nRelated article\nHow ready is China’s military? Dramatic downfall of two defense ministers raises questions\n \n            “Recurring purges of the senior-most PLA leaders indicate that Xi Jinping distrusts his officer corps,” said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the RSIS.\n     \n            “The constant removal of so many senior officers, as well as the extent of corruption running to the very top undoubtedly has an effect on the PLA’s morale, and likely also its military capabilities,” Thompson added.\n     \n            But some analysts noted that by this point, the PLA may have well become accustomed to the shake-ups in its high command.\n     \n            “Leadership purges in the PLA seem to have become normalized to a point that it’s just part and parcel of being the PLA,” said Collin Koh, another research fellow at RSIS.\n     \n            The Chinese military may have started to grow accustomed to the purges – to a point where it is able to isolate them from its daily operational activities and go on with business as usual, Koh noted.\n     \n            “It does not necessarily mean that because of the purges, the PLA has started to relent on readiness. These purges might potentially have the effect of reminding the PLA to do their work better – if anything, if you want to escape the purges, then one way to do that is to obey what the party is telling you, which is to be prepared for conflict,” he said.\n     \n            Like Miao, He is widely believed to have forged close personal ties with Xi during their overlapping years in Fujian, where the future Chinese leader was rising through the ranks as a local official in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n     \n            Both He and Miao spent most of their early career serving in the former 31st Group Army in Fujian, which became a major power base for Xi. A string of military officers hailing from the 31st Group Army have been fast-tracked for promotion since Xi took power in late 2012.\n     \n            Gen. He was no exception. In 2013, he was promoted to commander of Jiangsu Military District; less than a year later, he became commander of the Shanghai Garrison. In 2016, he was promoted yet again to command ground forces of the Western Theater Command, which oversees China’s border with India.\n     \n            He was promoted to full general in 2017, when he became commander of the Eastern Theater Command, responsible for leading any military invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n     \n            But the ultimate sign of Xi’s trust in He came at the 20th Party Congress in 2022, when He landed the CMC vice chairmanship – an unusually rapid rise for an official who hadn’t served on the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party.\n     \n            During that leadership reshuffle, Xi stacked the CMC with six loyalists. If confirmed to be under investigation, He would be the powerful military body’s first sitting vice chairman to be purged by Xi and the third member on the current CMC to fall from grace.\n     \n            The last time a sitting CMC vice chair was purged was more than three decades ago, when then-Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was ousted for sympathizing with student protesters in the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement.\n     \n            “What happens finally to He Weidong gives us a window into how the political system in China is being restructured further under Xi Jinping,” Char said, noting the PLA’s reform of its rigid political structure.\n     \n            “I don’t think anyone in the system now is irreplaceable,” he said. “This is what a political strong man does. He’s ruthless… he’s continuously purging his own ranks to keep his generals on their toes.”",

      "full_content": "Moving iPhone production from China to the United States could increase manufacturing costs by up to 90%, analysts at Bank of America warned on Wednesday (via Bloomberg). According to BofA analysts led by Wamsi Mohan, shifting iPhone assembly to America is technically possible, however it would dramatically increase production expenses and create logistical complications. \"iPhone cost can increase 25% purely on higher labor cost in the U.S.,\" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. They explained that even if Apple finds domestic workers for final assembly, a \"significant portion\" of iPhone components would still need to be manufactured in China and imported to the States. Assuming Apple faces reciprocal tariffs on those imported components, the total manufacturing cost could rise by 90% or more, the analysts estimated. The analysis follows statements from President Trump earlier this week calling Apple's manufacturing in China \"unsustainable.\" According to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump \"absolutely\" believes Apple could manufacture iPhones in the United States. During a recent media briefing, Leavitt said the President believes \"we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.\" Trump's aggressive trade policies singled out China on Wednesday, pausing reciprocal tariffs on 185 countries for 90 days but increasing duties on Chinese imports to 125%. In response, China has imposed 84% retaliatory levies on American goods. It's becoming increasingly difficult to assess where the stand-off goes from here. Uncertainty caused by the trade war has battered Apple's stock, which has fallen 14% since Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, erasing approximately $479 billion in market capitalization. Despite a recent 10% rebound, Apple shares remain down 23% year-to-date. For Apple to make U.S. assembly economically viable, Mohan suggests the company would need tariff waivers on components and subassemblies manufactured outside the country. However, he doesn't believe this is likely to happen. \"Unless it becomes clear as to how permanent the new tariffs are, we do not expect Apple to take the step of moving manufacturing into the U.S.,\" Mohan stated. Instead, he anticipates Apple will \"continue to diversify its supply chain, and also increase production of iPhones in other countries such as India.\" Apple has not officially commented on how it plans to address the current tariff situation. Apple will need to pay the 125% tariff on all goods coming to the United States from China, but it can import devices from other countries like India, Taiwan, and Vietnam at the lower 10% rate.

      "full_content": "A skier in Colorado had a close call this past weekend. A video taken Sunday by an employee at the Keystone Ski Resort in Keystone, Colorado, shows skier Brian O'Neal coming down the slopes at the same time as a black bear appears out of nowhere and runs in his direction. Luckily, the skier managed to avoid a closer encounter and the bear disappeared into a nearby forest. “All of a sudden from the right side of my eye, side-vision, it was like, 'Oh crap, here comes something,'” O’Neal told Summit Daily News. “Usually, you might see moose up there, but I’ve never seen a bear.” In an interview with Storyful, the resort employee who took the video said that he and some friends had gone out to look for the bear after hearing of people having encounters with the animal. \"We found the bear while he was walking through the trees of connecting runs,\" Nathan Lynch said. \"So, me and my friends went to the run that the bear was heading to next and waited for him to run out. When he did, I thankfully had my camera out.\" O'Neal told Summit Daily News that the incident happened on his first ski run of the day. “It happened so quick,” O’Neal said. “I was just trying not to run into it.” It was the last day for skiing at the resort for the season, the outlet reported.

He's wrong —  it won't happen during his term, if it happens at all.\r During a press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to a question about whether Trump believes iPhone production could ultimately move to the U.S. Apparently, President Trump thinks the United States has the resources and the workforce necessary for such an endeavor.\rLeavitt said that Trump was looking to bring manufacturing jobs \"back home\" to the United States and that he was \"looking at advanced technologies,\" among other things:\rSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe president wants to increase manufacturing jobs here in the United States of America, but he's also looking at advanced technologies. He's also looking at AI and emerging fields that are growing around the world that the United States needs to be a leader in as well. There's an array of diverse jobs. More traditional manufacturing jobs, as you discussed, and also jobs in advanced technologies. The president is looking at all of those. He wants them to come back home.The question referenced a recent statement by the U.S. Secretary of State Howard Lutnick, who said that \"the army of millions and millions of people screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones\" would be coming to America. Leavitt's response indicates that President Trump agrees with Lutnick's assessment.\rThe use of \"screws\" in this context is a gross over-simplification of iPhone assembly, which should be incredibly obvious to even the most casual observer. Multiple high-tech components, material suppliers, and manufacturers are also involved, as Apple sources finished components from the likes of Sony, LG, and, of course, TSMC for Apple Silicon chips.\rIn a follow-up question, Leavitt was asked specifically about iPhone production in the United States, and whether that type of technology could be brought over. \r\"Absolutely,\" Leavitt remarked, adding that President Trump believes the U.S. has the necessary resources for iPhone manufacturing. \rTo support that claim, Leavitt said that Apple wouldn't have invested $500 billion in the United States if they believed the country couldn't handle iPhone assembly. In reality, the $500B U.S. investment referenced by Leavitt has very little to do with the iPhone, almost nothing to do overall with Apple hardware manufacturing, and isn't anything out of the ordinary for Apple, as it is nearly all prior announcements. \rThese remarks are all made despite the United States not having a single iPhone assembly facility that takes four or more years to build, does not have inexpensive and skilled labor that can take decades to foster, has to import nearly all of rare earth materials to make an iPhone that will all be tariffed on their own, and there are no sub-assembly factories to use those raw materials necessary for iPhone component production.\rIn short, the entire supply chain for the iPhone doesn't exist in the US. Most of it would have to be generated from scratch.\rThis will take at least five years without training a labor force. That may take an entire generation.

While unlikely, Apple may secure a tariff exemption again, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has a way of negotiating with President Trump.\rIn any case, moving manufacturing efforts to the United States wouldn't solve any problems. Even if, through some miracle, Apple managed to source all components domestically, plants started up instantly, and a skilled workforce manifested magically, that would drive costs through the roof, and US consumers likely wouldn't put up with it.

      "full_content": "Dead Talents Society’s John Hsu explains how World of Warcraft, Perfect Blue, and ‘the Taiwanese Logan Paul’ shaped him by  Tasha Robinson If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Not many people make the jump from YouTube video game parodist to feature filmmaker, but that just makes the few who do, like director John Hsu, all the more fascinating. Hsu spent 10 years making World of Warcraft parody machinima shorts for YouTube under Blizzard’s auspices before getting tapped to direct Detention, the film adaptation of the elegant historical-horror game of the same name. Hsu’s latest, the riotous horror-comedy Dead Talents Society, just hit Netflix, and he told Polygon it’s much more indicative of his personal voice: Detention is serious horror, but Dead Talents Society is an extended goof that makes fun of everything from influencer culture to reality TV to idol pop. Dead Talents Society is a dazzling, frantic film: It follows a group of ghosts trying to achieve fame and fortune in the afterlife. Donning gimmicky, flashy personas, these “ghostresses” try to become urban legends and attract clout-hungry debunkers who’ll spread their fame to the mortal realm. Catherine (Sandrine Pinna) is an award-winning former ghost superstar who haunts hotel rooms, but her protégé Jessica (Eleven Yao) has recently eclipsed her by haunting the entire internet. Enter “The Rookie” (Gingle Wang), a recently dead teenager who’s terrible at haunting. All these women (and other characters in the movie) died trying to be seen and recognized, and were killed by something representing the admiration they were chasing: smashed by a falling light during a shoot, crushed by a bookcase full of awards. Now they’re competing with each other even in death. It’s a silly prospect with an extremely goofy execution, but the movie has its sweet and sincere moments as well. And Hsu makes it clear there’s a lot of philosophy behind it all, and a lot of ingesting and reflecting an extensive array of forums where people seek attention, from social media to idol pop. Polygon talked to Hsu about World of Warcraft videos, Dead Talents Society’s pointed nod to Perfect Blue, and the cautionary tale of “the Taiwanese Logan Paul.” This interview has been edited for clarity and concision. Polygon: How did you get started making World of Warcraft videos for Blizzard? John Hsu: I’ve been a gamer since I was 5. I still play a lot of video games. During the release of World of Warcraft in Taiwan, Blizzard held a video contest to use World of Warcraft footage to make short films. Me and my two classmates, we all went to the same film school, and we all played World of Warcraft, so we submitted several videos. We actually won a contest, and Blizzard collaborated with us to make machinima videos. So we would shoot short films inside the game just to make fun of it. We had a YouTube channel back in 2010, called AFK PL@YERS. We had a lot of fans. When Dead Talents Society was released [in Taiwan], a lot of fans of our channel went to see the film, because we put in several references to those videos. For example, there’s one song we did during that period of time that we put in as an Easter egg in Dead Talents Society, and there are also a lot of actors in the film that did voice-overs for our animation, so it’s kind of like a reunion. Is there anything particular about World of Warcraft that spoke to your comedic tastes? This definitely was practice for me, to get used to genre storytelling, because as a Taiwanese filmmaker, we didn’t really have that much opportunity to practice on different kinds of genres. Like action films — car chases or big-budget fights. And it gave us a lot of exercise in terms of the timing of the comedy. You’re also known for the 2019 adaptation of the video game Detention, but you’ve said in interviews that you felt constrained on that one because it had to be a very serious movie compared with what you’re doing here. It was originally a Taiwanese video game. Since I’m such a huge gamer — they realized it might be a good idea to have someone who’s familiar with gaming culture make that film. It’s not that I’m particularly interested in horror or history, but it’s because of the fact that I’m a gamer that I got that job. But most of my short films before that, and Dead Talents Society — what I mostly do is comedies or satire. Did you learn useful things from Detention? Yeah, because it was my first feature, and the production was so huge — I was totally blown away by how complicated it is to make a feature film. But at the same time, it also gave me some flexibility. I knew Dead Talents Society would be more personal to me and the actors, so it was nice to have this kind of experience first. There are so many satirical elements in Dead Talents Society, mocking reality competition shows and Asian horror cinema, awards shows and social media and stunt streamers and idol pop. Did you spend a lot of time studying all this different media to get the tone and the elements right? Not intentionally. We grew up with all this stuff. It’s our childhood. We grew up with the pop culture phenomenon back in the ’90s in Taiwan. [With the satirical pop idol video in the movie], there were a lot of male and female idols doing exactly the same thing. When you watch those music videos now, you might feel a little bit awkward, but they’re iconic for that period of time. And since the theme of our film is about being seen, throughout different times and in different ways, and What are you willing to do or sacrifice in terms of being seen?, being able to combine different methods or media where characters could be seen was important. Because they’re dead, they’re ghosts, they can be coming from different eras. For Catherine, it was probably the ’70 or ’80s when she died, and television was the most important stage for someone who wants to become famous, wants to be seen. But Jessica died at the beginning of the internet. And for Makoto and the new girl, it’s the influencer era, the rise of influencers. So [the mechanics of fame] are all kind of different, but they’re all talking about the same thing: How media affects our own value, and we build our identities around other people’s opinions. It’s all the same topic, but from different angles. That’s why we have so many different kinds of media put together. You have talked in the past about having to study influencer culture to understand it, because you didn’t grow up with it like you did with pop videos or TV. Well, we couldn’t interview ghosts, so we just interviewed influencers. What did you learn about influencer culture that surprised you? The same situation [about seeking fame] got worse with influencers, because they need to make a video weekly, or even sometimes daily, to get views. They always need to come up with new ideas, too. And it can be such a toxic thing for one’s mentality. I’ve been watching documentaries about influencers, and you can tell they’re all suffering from some kind of burnout that’s really harmful for their identities. I remember there was one Taiwanese influencer who always got views from doing stupid stuff. He’s in jail now. He was like the Taiwanese Logan Paul, always doing really stupid stuff. For example, he would drink his own piss for a video. If you drink your piss, what are you going to do next to top the views, to get more views? It’s like a curse that’s never going to end. In the documentary [I watched], you can tell he’s actually quite normal. The crazy side is just a persona. But in order to get more views, he would put on that persona and do stupid stuff. And I feel like that’s really sad. In that documentary, there are also scenes from his partner saying he was suicidal. [And now he’s in jail] because he was selling some kind of AI-generated porn of celebrities. It’s crazy. I can see how that works into the film, as the characters put on wild, over-the-top personas in order to land as urban legends, but they’re constantly chasing novelty and trying to be outrageous and extreme. I caught some of the references, like the Perfect Blue dress or the Ringu-style hair-in-the-face ghost, but I kept wondering if there were other similarly specific gags I was missing. There are a lot! The girl in the red riding hood is an urban legend in Taiwan, probably the most popular urban legend in Taiwan. They made a series of films about her. So she’s really the biggest star in terms of the ghost world. There’s a series of horror films about urban legends — there’s a movie about the yellow raincoat guys releasing this year. What about Catherine, the hotel ghost? The backstory behind the leading actors are fictional, or referencing certain subgenres of horror. For example, Jessica is a representative of spirits that use technology to scare people — The Ring or One Missed Call, something like that. But [all the background] ghost characters are actually Taiwanese urban legends, every one of them. So we did some research with a book called The Taiwanese Urban Legend Encyclopedia. It’s like a record of every Taiwanese ghost story. So whenever we needed a side character, we would just flip the pages and see what was in it. How did you get to the Perfect Blue costume reference? It was actually quite late in the production. When we decided on Jessica’s character, even if we don’t have the time for the backstory [in the movie], we did have our setup: She might be someone who wanted to become a star or an idol in the early 2000s and she was accidentally killed during an audition. So our costume designer gave this one of the options for her. She was presenting four or five different costumes for me, and asked me to choose one of them. And I immediately recognized that dress from Perfect Blue. I was like, “Are you kidding me? Are you seriously putting that as one of your options?” And she was saying, “But you like it, right?” I was like, “Yeah, I love Kon Satoshi. He’s one of my biggest inspirations. So yeah, why not?” And thematically, it’s also quite similar — Perfect Blue is also about the price you have to pay in order to be seen. Is there anything you feel you’ve taken from his work or learned from his work? The tempo of his films is really fast. I really enjoy his fast-paced storytelling methods. I also admire how he constructs characters. In Tokyo Godfathers, he has three homeless losers, but they become a found family. I’m a sucker for those stories. And we did have this in Dead Talents Society, too — they’re also a bunch of losers. And they’re trying so hard to do something that’s actually super stupid, but at the same time, it’s so important to them. When we came up with the idea of having all five of them dressing up in sailor uniforms and chasing those influencers, even though they know it’s going to be in vain — that kind of reminded me of the climax of Tokyo Godfathers and Little Miss Sunshine at the same time. Dead Talents Society is streaming on Netflix now. Detention is streaming for free with ads on Tubi and Amazon Video and is available for rental or purchase on Apple TV and other digital platforms.

Trump's remarks come just after he signed an executive order to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports on Wednesday, which will likely affect European carmakers. Since returning to office in January, Trump has also introduced sweeping 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. His administration has placed a 25% tariff on almost all imports from Canada and Mexico and raised tariffs to 20% for China. Canada announced in early March that it was retaliating with a 25% tariff on $155 billion of American goods. In March, freshly sworn-in Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney chose to make his first overseas visits to France and the UK instead of the US. During his trip to France earlier this month, Carney called Canada the \"most European of non-European countries.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The threat of tariffs comes as Washington's relations with its European allies already face strain from Trump's public position on defense cooperation. The president has repeatedly raised doubts about US commitments to defending Europe, saying that its countries were taking advantage of the US and not pulling their weight. \"It's common sense, right?\" Trump told reporters earlier this month. \"If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them.\" Europe heavily relies on the US military, which stations key bases throughout the continent, while many of the continent's armed forces buy advanced American weapons. Several key capabilities, such as Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II, form the pillars of many European militaries and depend on American parts and maintenance workers. Leaders in several countries, such as Portugal and Denmark, have expressed concerns about that exposure, indicating they may no longer view the F-35 as the best option for their countries. Canada's defense minister has also signaled similar apprehension, saying Ottawa was looking at \"other alternatives\" after Trump commented that Canada could be the 51st US state. The fate of the aircraft's foreign sales could belie a larger shift in Europe's long-standing trust in the American system — once thought to be a near-impregnable relationship in the post-World War II era. The rest of the European Union, largely in response to Trump's rhetoric, has proposed a plan to massively increase domestic defense spending by $840 billion in an \"era of rearmament.\"",

Otherwise, you could be paying an arm and a leg more for the exact same products now that Trump’s trade tariffs have been put in place. I’d like to clarify that this article is merely for information, here at DIYP we are staying politically neutral. Please keep any comments friendly and free from political diatribes, as I’m sure most of our lovely readers usually do 😉 For anyone who’s been living off-grid or under a rock for the past week, let’s just go over what these tariffs are. Last week, President Trump announced new trade tariffs that will be implemented on imports from other countries into the USA. The rest of the world has spent the week reeling from the news due to the unprecedented high rates. The move is to promote America-made manufacturing and products. However, in reality, the effects are more complicated. These tariffs are essentially an import tax and are to be paid by the importer when the goods enter the USA. Obviously, these taxes will be passed onto the consumer so that the business importing items can maintain their usual profit margin (although many will likely take a hit too). If you want a detailed economic breakdown, then there are several good sources; however, in basic terms, this means that prices will likely rise for the average American consumer. This includes camera equipment.  These countries are to have the following tariffs placed on them: “All well and good,” you might think. “We need jobs and industry in America, and America first isn’t a bad stance.” But let’s take a quick look at where most camera equipment is manufactured (hint: it’s mostly not in the USA). Mirrorless Rumours helpfully published a list of the locations where most camera products are manufactured. First, let’s look at the ones based in the USA. These would be RED cine cameras (although now that Nikon owns them that could change) and some Blackmagic products (although Blackmagic is actually Australian-owned). Additionally, some specialist scientific, military, and industrial cameras are made in the US, such as FLIR, Teledyne DALSA, and Vision Research, which produce high-speed, thermal, or industrial-grade cameras. You’ll notice that all of these cameras are pretty specialised (either for cinema or research) and do not include any of the major camera brands. Here’s where those household names are manufactured: As you can see, the majority of the world’s cameras are manufactured in a small concentration of countries. These same countries are set to be hit by between 20 and 46% of import tariffs, if they go ahead as stated last week by President Trump. Sony Alpha Rumours published a worst-case scenario table of potential camera prices after the tariffs were applied. A Canon R5 Mark II, which currently sells for $3,999, could end up costing $4,958.76 after the 24% tariff is applied. Similarly, an already costly Leica M11 manufactured in Germany will end up costing $10,794.00 rather than the previous $8,995. Remember that this will also apply to lenses, film stocks, lighting gear, bags, and other accessories manufactured outside of the US. Ordinarily, tariffs are applied to protect the manufacturing interests of the country applying them in the hope that they will force companies to open manufacturing bases in the US. However, the short-term outlook is that this is incredibly difficult and costly to implement and is not a viable short-term solution if there is no infrastructure already in place. Not to mention, the labour costs are drastically higher in the USA than in Vietnam, for example. However, the good news is that the camera brands do value their not-insignificant US customer base and likely don’t want to lose those sales. DJI recently confirmed to DCW that “Tariffs are one of several factors that we consider in our comprehensive pricing strategy (…) Our commitment to closely monitoring relevant policies and economic indicators is unwavering, as is our dedication to providing high-quality products at the best possible price.” There are rumours that these tariffs will be re-negotiated, so we mustn’t panic and assume that the world will spiral into an economic depression. However, it is likely that camera prices will increase. My stab-in-the-dark guess is that prices will increase globally, not just in the USA, to keep markets somewhat stable in a global industry and additionally to discourage black-market trading. Another possible outcome is that the camera brands will delay launching new products, particularly if there is a threat of an economic downturn. Similarly, the second-hand camera gear market is likely to be affected too, as it reacts to supply and demand, so expect eBay and MPB deals to be more pricey as well. Our advice would be to buy any gear you’re considering now, while current stocks last (although even those could end up with an anticipatory increase in price).

Vietnam, a huge clothing supplier to the US, is already begging; others will follow and reduce their tariffs on US products thereby causing a reduction by the US on their goods. Why should they Vietnam come begging?  They are a country with a GDP 1/70th the US. They buy a far higher percentage of their GDP from the US than the US buys from them. The US had a shooting war with Vietnam just 50 years ago.  Launching a trade war with them and other countries does not endure us to them.

      "full_content": "A confidential Pentagon document suggests the United States may not come to Europe's aid in the event of a Russian attack. The leaked internal memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose staggering 'lies' were exposed this week, is said to prioritise deterring China's ambitions over Taiwan and bolstering defense measures on U.S. soil.  According to The Washington Post, parts of the memo are strikingly similar to a publication by a conservative think tank involved with Project 2025, with sections mirroring it word for word. It comes amid another Hegseth scandal over his tattoo and a panicked phone call from Trump over Elon Musk.  The memo outlines Hegseth's stance that America is unlikely to offer significant support to Europe against Russian aggression. It highlights an expectation for NATO allies to assume the primary role in defending their territory.  The United States, the guidance suggests, will provide nuclear deterrence against Russia but will only commit forces that are not essential for homeland security or missions related to China. The document underscores the importance of increased defense contributions from European nations, stating that this \"will also ensure NATO can reliably deter or defeat Russian aggression even if deterrence fails and the United States is already engaged in, or must withhold forces to deter, a primary conflict in another region.\" The latest memo aligns the Pentagon's strategy with President Trump's global security concerns, particularly highlighting undefined threats from the \"near abroad\". In the document, Trump insists that U.S. forces must be \"ready to defend American interests wherever they might be threatened in our hemisphere, from Greenland, to the Panama Canal, to Cape Horn.\" On Friday, March 28, Trump's declaration \"we have to have Greenland\" ramped up tensions with Denmark, a NATO ally responsible for the autonomous island's foreign affairs and defence. The interim guidance spans nine pages and bears striking resemblances to a more extensive report set for 2024 by the Heritage Foundation, with several sections appearing almost verbatim when compared by The Washington Post. The Heritage Foundation has not responded to The Washington Post's request for a statement. It's been a bad week for Hegseth, who was embroiled in the Signal-gate text scandal.  Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, accused the Secretary of Defense of lying about sharing war plans in a Signal group chat.   Goldberg was accidentally added to this chat last month and released screenshots that contradict Hegseth's previous claims.   Hegseth had insisted that no war plans were discussed in the private group on the encrypted messaging platform. \"Nobody was texting war plans. And that's all I have to say about that,\" the former Fox News pundit stated when questioned by a reporter. He also claimed he had never met Goldberg.   The journalist addressed the issue in his latest column, saying: \"So, about that Signal chat.\" He continued, \"On Monday, shortly after we published a story about a massive Trump-administration security breach, a reporter asked the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, why he had shared plans about a forthcoming attack on Yemen on the Signal messaging app.\"  Hegseth denied discussing war plans, but Goldberg's screenshots suggest otherwise, showing Hegseth detailing the day's events.",

      "full_content": "British luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover is halting shipments of its cars to the US this month as it navigates President Donald Trump's new 25% tariff on imported automobiles. In a statement Saturday, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider: \"The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.\" The Times of London first reported the pause. JLR said in a separate statement on Wednesday that its brands were \"accustomed to changing market conditions\" and that it was prioritizing \"delivering for our clients around the world and addressing these new US trading terms.\" The company, which employs almost 40,000 people across the world, is one of the UK's most iconic carmakers and has long been popular with celebrities in both Britain and the US. JLR's retail sales were up 21.7% to just over 430,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2023 to 2024, including roughly 95,000 in North America, according to its annual report. JLR's decision to pause US shipments follows a massive global stock market sell-off sparked by Trump's slew of new tariffs, which he announced this week. A baseline 10% tariff on trading partners came into effect on Saturday, while higher levies on some nations are set to begin on April 9. While Trump sees the duties as a means of bolstering domestic investment and \"supercharging\" the economy, many analysts are questioning the potential economic consequences.",

      "full_content": "Self-ruled island ‘strongly’ condemns Chinese actions, says it deployed military vessels and aircraft to monitor the drills. China holds large-scale military drills around Taiwan China has launched a new round of military exercises around Taiwan in its latest “warning” to the island’s democratic government. The Chinese military said on Tuesday that the drills served as a “powerful deterrent” to “separatist forces” advocating Taiwanese independence. The exercises are intended to test the “combat readiness” of China’s army, navy, air force, and rocket force, and their ability to work together during a joint military operation, the Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. The drills were being carried out from multiple directions around Taiwan and focused on “sea and air combat readiness patrols, seizing comprehensive control, sea and land strikes, and blocking key areas and roads”, the command added. Taiwan’s Presidential Office said it “strongly condemned” China’s actions, while its Defence Ministry announced it had deployed military vessels and aircraft to monitor the drills. China considers Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, part of its territory and has pledged to take control of the island by force if necessary. Wen-ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said the military exercises appeared to be focused on containing and isolating Taiwan. “One of the scenarios that analysts have always been concerned about is the prospect of the Chinese military launching a quarantine or an embargo against waterways near Taiwan and how that may enable the PLA to squeeze Taiwan and starve Taiwan and thereby force it into submission,” Sung told Al Jazeera, using the acronym for the official name of China’s People’s Liberation Army. “This time around, that very manoeuvre of quarantine of key passageways around Taiwan is one of the main items on the PLA to-do list.” The Chinese Communist Party views Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te and his Democratic Progressive Party as “separatists”, and has staged military exercises with increasing frequency in response to their activities. In its announcement of the drills, the PLA released a short animation describing Lai as a “parasite poisoning Taiwan” while depicting the Taiwanese leader being held to a fire with a set of chopsticks.      During a regular news briefing later on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said efforts towards Taiwan independence were not going to succeed. “[Taiwan] authorities’ stubborn persistence with the Taiwan independence stance and their futile attempt to split the country from outside by seeking independence is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot; it is doomed to fail,”  told a regular briefing. The latest round of military exercises comes after Lai last month called Beijing a “foreign hostile force” and laid out a 17-point plan to curtail its ongoing political infiltration, espionage and influence operations in Taiwan. On Monday, Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office accused Lai of stirring up “anti-China sentiment” and intensifying tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Despite the uptick in military exercises, Sung said Lai’s “cross-Strait policy towards China enjoys majority support in Taiwan”, and Beijing’s responses to his actions are seen as “regrettable”. In an opinion poll released by the Taiwanese website My Formosa last month, 57 percent of respondents said they had trust in Lai and 56 percent said they approved of his job performance, up 6 points and 7 percentage points, respectively, from the previous poll. The website linked the uptick in Lai’s support to his speech taking aim at Beijing. China last held military exercises near Taiwan in December, after Lai made visits to three Pacific island states, the US state of Hawaii, and the US territory of Guam. China held bigger drills in May and October 2024 to coincide with Lai’s inauguration and Taiwan’s national day, respectively. Beijing has stepped up its use of military drills since August 2022, when the then-speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, became the highest-ranking US official to visit the island in a quarter century.",

      "full_content": "Beer, famously good for your hair, so why not for your face too? Well, Heineken’s Smootheriser makes the case that beer for the belly is good enough for the hair, and can be great for the face too. Developed in-house and launching in Taiwan and Cambodia, the Smootheriser uses the same quality hops and barley as its alcoholic counterpart – but instead of working your liver, it hydrates your skin. What first started as an April Fool’s Joke actually spun off into a full-fledged product development exercise. I’m not kidding – Heineken’s own press release says “This isn’t an April Fool’s Joke.” The Heineken® Smootheriser will launch in Cambodia and Taiwan, coinciding with the beverage company’s marketing of Heineken Silver – its premium beer offering. I guess (facial) beauty really is in the eyes of the beer holder. Designer: Heineken \n\n\n\n\n It’s not entirely clear if the skin cream will be a limited-edition offering or something Heineken will develop continually for the near future – but the cream is a way of drawing attention to Heineken Silver – one of the company’s most popular beers. Brewed at -1°C for its signature crisp taste, Heineken Silver has a fairly large fan-base… and if the company can also get the same people to keep their skin looking flawlessly moisturized, I guess that’s a win for everyone. The launch in Asia hopes to tap into the massive skincare-enthusiast market in the region, providing a premium product made using the same high-quality ingredients as their beer.  Heineken obviously gets the fact that announcing this on the first of April comes with its level of extra skepticism. I went through the press release multiple times too – but I guess you have to take a company on its word when it does specify it in a press release. After all, sometimes jokes can have a pretty adverse impact on a company’s valuation in the stock market – remember Volkswagen teasing that they were rebranding to Voltswagen? The Smootheriser, arguably, feels much better-planned. It’s sure to make people laugh, then become actually curious, and hopefully relent. Maybe Heineken should launch a beer-flavored Lip Gloss next?! \n\n\n\n\n I’ve always envied people with tattoos—the commitment, the clarity, the sheer audacity of saying, “Yes, I want this specific thing on my body forever.” Me?… Meet the Dynamic Folio – a case from the folks at MOFT that elevates your iPad. Literally. And at multiple heights and angles, that too…. With colorful layers and an almost chem-lab aesthetic, the Roots series of vases are a clever twist on the classic tiered flower vase.

      "full_content": "The case marks a first for Taiwan in prosecuting what it alleged is deliberate damage to a subsea cable. Taiwanese prosecutors have formally charged the captain of a Chinese-crewed cargo ship that Taipei says severed one of its subsea cables earlier this year. The Togo-flagged Hong Tai 58 was detained by Taiwan’s coastguard in February near the site of a cable breakdown amid allegations that it had deliberately dropped its anchor to cause damage. The ship’s captain, who was only identified to the public by his surname Wang, was charged on Friday with being responsible for the incident, the prosecutors said. Seven Chinese nationals who were on board the ship will not be charged, and will be transported back to China, the prosecutors added. The case marks a first for Taiwan, where subsea cables have become the latest front in what is described as “hybrid warfare” or “grey zone activity” with China. The terms refer to low-grade coercive acts such as sabotage that hold a certain degree of plausible deniability. China has long claimed Taiwan, an island with a population of 23 million, as a province of the mainland and has threatened to annex it by force, if necessary. China has yet to reply to the charges against Wang, but it has previously accused Taipei of “manipulating” the facts of the accident to cast Beijing in a bad light.      Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, previously described the subsea cable incident as a “common maritime accident”. Wang declined to provide Taiwanese authorities with information about the ship’s ownership, according to prosecutors, but the Hong Tai 58 is believed to be a so-called Chinese “dark ship” acting unofficially on behalf of Beijing. “Dark ships” have earned their name due to the practice of broadcasting multiple or false identities to maritime authorities. Sometimes the vessels may turn off identification signals to avoid detection, according to industry experts. Since 2023, there have been at least 11 cases of subsea cable breakdowns around Taiwan, although some were later ruled as accidents or due to the old age of the equipment. Subsea cables are the backbone of the internet and global telecoms industry, but they are also susceptible to breakdowns from movements on the sea floor or human activity. Between 100 and 200 cable breakdowns occur each year, according to industry data, and proving damage as deliberate is notoriously difficult and a challenge for governments beyond Taipei. Countries around the Baltic Sea have also seen an uptick in subsea cable breakdowns since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and they have also struggled to bring legal cases against Chinese and Russia-linked ships and their owners.",

      "full_content": "After a tidal wave of rumors and leaks, the Google Pixel 9a saw an official announcement earlier this month — and now we know it will be available for purchase on April 10 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. On April 14, the Pixel 9a will make its way to an additional 23 European countries, before finally arriving in India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia on April 16. This midrange budget handset will start at $499 for the 128GB model, with a bump up to $599 for the 256GB model. It has a 6.3-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, paired with a maximum brightness of 2700 nits. That means you’ll be able to use it in direct sunlight without worrying about visibility. All models come with 8GB of RAM, regardless of the amount of storage. That’s more than enough to power a slew of different Android and Google Play games, as well as Gemini AI features. The Google Pixel 9a ships with Android 15 and supports seven major Android upgrades throughout its lifespan. As far as cameras go, it has a 48MP wide angle lens and a 12MP ultrawide angle lens, along with a 13MP ultrawide selfie cam. The phone can record 1080p video up to 240 frames per second, or up to 60 frames per second at 4K. A 5,100mAh battery will keep you going throughout the day, and 23W wired charging (along with 7.5W wireless charging) will help you top off your charge when it starts to run low. While the Google Pixel 9a might not be a flagship, it’s no slouch, either. It’s a solid midrange competitor that can go toe to toe with many lower-end flagships without breaking a sweat, and it’s a great option for someone that wants to test out the Pixel ecosystem without spending a fortune on one of the frontrunners — or settling for an older, outdated model.",

      "full_content": "Best Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower Personal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower This is CNBC's coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers responded to President Donald Trump's new tariffs. CNBC's reporters covered the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Read CNBC's continued coverage of Trump's historic tariff plan here. The weekend is looking like a breeze for Trump — if not for stock market investors hammered by the fallout from his new tariffs. The White House posted a tweet showing Trump walking with his hair, tie and suit jacket blown back from the wind, with the italicized message, \"Almost Friday.\" The tweet's jaunty vibe contrasted with a metaphorical bloodbath on Wall Street, where the major stock indices all suffered big drops. Nissan Motor's luxury Infiniti brand has indefinitely paused production of two Mexico-built crossovers for the U.S. in response to the newly imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles by Trump. In a memo to the brand's retailers, Infiniti Americas Vice President Tiago Castro said QX50 and QX55 output for the U.S. is halted \"until further notice\" due to the tariffs, Automotive News reported Thursday. A company spokesman confirmed the actions Thursday afternoon to CNBC and said the Japanese automaker is reviewing its \"production and supply chain operations to identify optimal solutions for efficiency and sustainability.\" \"We will continue to evaluate the impact, as well as market needs, to make any additional adjustments to production,\" Nissan said in an emailed statement. Separately, Nissan on Thursday confirmed it will maintain two shifts of production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant that is free of the new auto tariffs. Nissan had planned to scale back Rogue production in Smyrna to a single shift starting this month. The European Union and Switzerland, two crucial markets for luxury goods, were hit with tariffs of 20% and 31%, respectively. Compared with their luxury peers, Swiss watchmakers stand to be most affected, JPMorgan analysts said in a note.  Analysts highlighted Swiss conglomerates Swatch Group, which counts Omega among its brands, and Richemont, owner of Piaget, noting their thin margins. The Swatch Group fell nearly 4% and shares of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA dropped 6.3% in trading. Gucci owner Kering and Burberry are also vulnerable, according to the analysts, citing weak profits and \"less pricing power to mitigate some of the impact given their currently softer brand momentum.\" Kering and Burberry shares fell 7.5% and 9.2%, respectively. As for luxury powerhouse LVMH, analysts estimated its wine and spirits division, which includes cognac brand Hennessy, would be most negatively affected.  Hermès faces the least damage before mitigation, estimated at roughly 3% to 5% by JPMorgan. Analysts said Hermès has less reliance on U.S. sales, high profitability and strong pricing power. LVMH ended down more than 3%. Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that Hermes is a separate, publicly traded company. After multiple White House aides insisted that the new tariffs were not a negotiation, Trump said he would be open to negotiating with other countries about the duties. Trump said he would be open to tariff talks with other counties if they offer something phenomenal, Reuters reported him saying on Air Force One. Top trade aide Peter Navarro told CNBC less than an hour earlier that the sweeping tariffs are \"not a negotiation.\" Some big names in the market took the brunt of the punishment on Thursday, with Apple and Nike among the iconic American companies contributing in a major way to the S&P 500's worst day since 2020. But the tariff wall that Trump is building around the U.S. is estimated at nearly $1 trillion, according to data shared with CNBC by Trade Partnership Worldwide. They will have profound consequences throughout the market and global supply chain, across each American state and into the lives of every consumer. Trade experts are skeptical that negotiations will result in quick deals. Any manufacturing renaissance in the U.S. will come much later than an acute manufacturing crisis, experts told CNBC. U.S. CEOs, especially those in critical industries such as medical devices, are headed to Capitol Hill to plead their case. In a nutshell, it \"isn't good news for the global economy,\" as shipping giant Maersk put it. Read the full story: Trump's other wall: $1 trillion in tariffs wrapped around U.S. economy— Lori Ann LaRocco Top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro denied that Trump's new tariffs are being used as a tool to negotiate better trade terms with other countries. \"This is not a negotiation,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime.\" \"This is not that. This is a national emergency,\" he said. The newly imposed tariffs pose a drag on growth, said Lindsay Rosner, Goldman Sachs head of multi-asset fixed income. The only question is how much. The extent of the drag will depend on several factors, such as other countries imposing retaliatory tariffs and the Trump administration's willingness to negotiate, Rosner told journalists at a conference at Goldman Sachs' Manhattan headquarters. She also noted that sectors and companies will not be equally affected by the tariffs. Rosner is also waiting to see how the Federal Reserve responds. \"They've got to push back here because I think the big word of 'stagflation' is real here,\" she said.  Stagflation occurs when inflation rises as economic growth slows. Finally, Rosner said she believes Wednesday's tariffs were just the beginning and wonders what the Trump administration will impose next. \"I think we all know there is more to come,\" she said. Shares in top U.S. exporter Boeing tumbled 10% and other aerospace stocks such as engine maker GE Aerospace also fell, as companies assessed tariff effects on their global supply chains. GE has a joint venture with France's Safran, and together they provide parts and build best-selling engines under their shared CFM brand. Those engines power Boeing and Airbus narrow-body planes. Aircraft are made with thousands of parts from all across the world. Even European plane maker Airbus, which has expanded its final assembly lines in Mobile, Alabama, over the past decade, relies on components made outside the U.S. Boeing, which assembles its 787 Dreamliner jets in South Carolina, has a supply chain spanning from Japan to Italy. \"There are still a lot of unknowns, such as how they are applied to aerospace, which tier of suppliers or customers will pay for them, and how trading partners will respond,\" Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote Thursday. She noted that aircraft and defense products boost U.S. exports and have been \"insulated via The Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, but raw [material] price inflation is unavoidable.\" Household staples such as coffee, bananas and toilet paper will likely get more expensive as the Trump administration's tariffs go into effect. The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group that represents Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and other consumer giants, is asking for exemptions for key ingredients and inputs that cannot be produced at scale in the U.S. As an example, the CBA pointed to the fact that the U.S. climate limits domestic production of tropical fruits, coffee and spices. The countries that do produce those goods, such as Guatemala and Madagascar, have been slapped with tariffs that range from 10% to 47%. Manufacturers and retailers will likely pass on the higher ingredient costs to shoppers. Inedible staples, such as toilet paper and shampoo, could become more expensive, too, due to higher costs for inputs such as wood pulp and palm oil, the CBA said. Federal Reserve officials could get caught in a policy box if tariffs spike inflation and weaken growth, diminishing the chances of an interest rate cut anytime soon. A general consensus emerged on Wall Street that unless the announced duties are negotiated down, core inflation this year likely will run north of 3%, and economic growth could be flat or negative as unemployment rises. In that case, the Fed would find itself torn between its \"dual mandate\" of full employment and low inflation. \"The problem for the Fed is that they're going to have to be very, be very reactive,\" said Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS. U.S. markets continue to fall as investors digest news of Trump's far-reaching tariffs. The selling has been accelerating into the close of trading at 4 p.m. ET. Read CNBC's full market coverage here. The formula used by the White House to determine its sweeping tariff policy looks like it could have come from artificial intelligence chatbots, according to The Verge, which on Thursday used some quick work done by journalist James Surowiecki and some commenters on X. Surowiecki wrote on X that it appears as if the Trump administration \"just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's exports to us.\" The Verge said its reporters got similar results when they asked popular AI chatbots — including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok — for \"easy\" ways to solve trade deficits or to put the U.S. on an \"even playing field\" with other countries.  The four bots gave \"the same fundamental suggestion,\" the Verge said, though some of the details provided by each one differed. Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson warned companies against price fixing in light of tariffs. The FTC \"will be watching closely to make sure American companies are vigorously competing on prices,\" he said in a post on social media site X. \"These necessary tariffs should not be interpreted as a green light for price fixing or any other unlawful behavior,\" Ferguson wrote. \"We will always protect American consumers.\" Trump said the response to his staggering new tariff plan is \"going very well.\" \"The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,\" he told reporters as he departed the White House. \"The rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?\" he said. Trump pointed to investment pledges that some companies have made in recent weeks, claiming that it totals almost $7 trillion. \"You'll see how it's going to turn out. Our country is going to boom,\" he said. Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said Thursday that Trump's tariff plan was more drastic than administration officials had signaled and will prove damaging if it is not scaled back. Speaking on CNBC's \"Halftime Report,\" he said major business leaders in the U.S. share that opinion. \"I talked to probably 10 CEOs who are all in the Business Roundtable — these are CEOs of the largest companies in America — overnight, and [they all] think this is a huge mistake. They think this is too much, that it will have lasting and cascading negative repercussions for the United States and the global economy,\" Gerstner said. Gerstner did not specify who spoke with him, but the members of the Business Roundtable include the CEOs of the biggest companies from multiple industries, including firms such as Apple, Bank of America, Boeing and FedEx. Gerstner, who generally focuses on the technology sector as an investor, said Trump's tariff plan \"looks like protectionism\" as opposed to a step toward more equitable global trade. Trump is set to depart the White House and head to his Doral Golf Club in Miami, where he will attend a dinner for LIV, the pro golf tour that has previously held tournaments at Trump's properties. After the event, Trump will fly to his Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, according to the White House. Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner said chipmaker Nvidia is positioned to weather Trump's broad tariffs. Nvidia produces the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that power the artificial intelligence boom. The company may be better positioned to withstand the effect of tariffs because semiconductors, like GPUs, are on the list of exceptions — what Gerstner called a \"wise exception.\" \"The growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,\" he told CNBC's \"Fast Money Halftime Report.\" Gerstner said he is concerned about the potential for a recession due to Trump's tariffs but is relatively bullish on Nvidia, saying the \"negative impact from tariffs will be much less than in other areas.\" The new wave of tariffs could have drastically different effects on the two leading U.S. dollar-store chains. Dollar Tree's stock dropped more than 10%, declining along with shares of other retailers that rely on manufacturing in China and Vietnam. But shares of rival Dollar General climbed more than 4%. Trump will slap an additional 34% tariff on imports from China, bringing new duties implemented on the nation's goods during his second term to 54%. That is worse news for Dollar Tree because according to a note from UBS analysts this week, the company's exposure to China is about 32% of its cost of goods sold. Dollar General only has about 4% exposure. During an earnings call last month, Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said the company could hike prices to help offset tariffs. LinkedIn co-founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman criticized Trump's tariffs policy, writing in a post on social media site X, \"This is a long game to hurt everyday Americans and consolidate power at the top.\" Hoffman is a major Democratic donor and was an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris during her presidential run. He has frequently criticized the Trump administration and previously expressed concern that Trump could retaliate against business leaders who did not back him. In his post Thursday, Hoffman said the Trump administration has eroded trust in U.S. markets, \"first with crypto grifts\" and now with tariff policies \"drafted by a team that can't even do basic mathematics.\" Small-cap stocks have entered bear market territory as markets reel in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. Watch CNBC's market blog for all the key updates as they happen. General Motors plans to temporarily increase pickup truck production at a plant in Indiana as the auto industry adjusts to Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. GM confirmed the plans without mentioning tariffs: \"General Motors will be making operational adjustments at Fort Wayne Assembly, including hiring temporary employees, to support current manufacturing and business needs. We continuously update and revise production schedules as part of our standard process of evaluating and aligning to manage vehicle inventory.\" The increase in workers is in addition to the supplemental workers GM was already hiring to support summer breaks and time off for their regular employees, according to a person familiar with the plans. GM produces its crucial, highly profitable pickup trucks such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra at various plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The Detroit automaker has not cut production at any plants as a result of the tariffs, like its crosstown rival Stellantis is doing, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak to media. American drinkers may be swapping out their Aperol spritzes for margaritas this summer. The Trump administration's 20% tariff on goods imported from the European Union will hit European wines, spirits and beer, Reuters reports. Mexican-imported canned beer such as Modelo, the best-selling beer in the U.S., will also face a new 25% tariff. Shares of Constellation Brands, which owns Mexican-brewed beers such as Modelo and Corona, are down less than 1% in afternoon trading. Investors have been anticipating the levies since Trump's election. But the tariffs were not as harsh as the 200% duties Trump threatened on European wine, Champagne and spirits last month. The president also held off on imposing the 25% tariffs on Mexican tequila and Canadian whisky, lifting shares of Campari, Heineken and Diageo higher. Matt Mittelsteadt, a tech policy research fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that the new tariffs \"directly threaten American AI. These massive tax hikes are slamming during the exact window U.S. industry has to set the global standard — risking innovation and ceding the market.\" Shares of CoreWeave, which recently became the first pure-play artificial intelligence company to IPO, were down more than 17% on Thursday. Nvidia stock was down nearly 7%, while shares of Microsoft and Google were both down more than 2%. Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman encouraged foreign leaders to reach out to Trump \"immediately\" to negotiate, according to a post on social media site X on Thursday. Ackman endorsed Trump in the 2024 election and has been a vocal supporter of the president on social media. In his post Thursday, he described Trump as a \"dealmaker\" and a \"tough, but fair negotiator\" who thinks about the world as a series of transactions. \"I expect Trump will reward the early dealmakers with fairer deals than those that wait to sit down at the negotiating table,\" Ackman wrote. \"Countries that respond with additional tariffs on our goods will be severely punished. The carrot and the stick writ large, Big Boy style.\" Canada will impose 25% tariffs on vehicles imported from the U.S., Prime Minister Mark Carney announced, matching Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles that took effect today. The tariffs will only apply to autos that are not compliant with the USMCA, the North American free trade agreement, Carney said. He said the tariffs will not affect auto parts or vehicle content from Mexico. \"We know the benefits of our integrated production system,\" Carney said. He added that Canada is \"developing a framework for auto producers to avoid our counter tariffs, as long as they maintain their production and investment in Canada.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump \"is not going to back off\" his newly announced tariffs. \"I don't think there's any chance\" that Trump will reverse course, Lutnick said in a CNN interview. \"This is the reordering of global trade, right? That's what's going to happen,\" he said. Asked to clarify, Lutnick said, \"the president is not going to back off.\" But, he added, \"countries can fix their tariffs, their non-tariff trade barriers, which are much, much rougher.\" The comments came as some Trump allies have expressed hope that the sweeping tariffs are negotiating tools to secure better trade relationships, rather than permanent import taxes. Trump's tariffs have boxed in retailers — and jeweler Pandora is not immune. The Danish company said it expects an annual hit of 1.2 billion crowns, or roughly $178 million, from the new duties on U.S. imports, before it takes any steps to mitigate the effects. For 2025, it expects a hit of 700 million crowns, or about $103 million. Pandora said it could raise prices or change its supply chain to help offset the levies. The jeweler said U.S. tariffs of 36% on imports from Thailand will have the biggest effect on its business. Pandora said it made 92% of its jewelry at facilities in Thailand as of last year. A bipartisan bill introduced to the Senate seeks to require that Congress approve tariffs if they are to continue 60 days after their implementation, NBC News reported. The bill also would require the president to notify Congress within 24 hours of announcing new tariffs. \"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. It is not clear when or even if the bill will be voted on. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed back on the looming prospect of grocery prices suddenly rising as a result of Trump's new tariffs. \"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Lutnick said on CNN when asked what he would tell Americans who voted for Trump and are about to face higher store prices. Lutnick said that when the U.S. opens the markets that he says are blocked by other countries, \"our volumes grow, our farmers will thrive, and the price of groceries will come down.\" \"Let Donald Trump run the global economy. He knows what he's doing,\" Lutnick said. Investors are seeking safety in fast-food chains, betting consumers will trade down to cheaper restaurant meals as tariffs weigh on their wallets. Shares of McDonald's, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International are up more than 1%, while other publicly traded restaurant companies' shares take a beating. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill and Texas Roadhouse are both down 3%. The two chains have reported stronger sales than the broader industry in recent quarters. Other eateries have seen even steeper declines in their share prices. Starbucks stock dropped 11%, Shake Shack's shares slid 13% and Sweetgreen's tumbled 16%. Typically, during economic downturns, fast-food chains report stronger sales than other restaurants, as price-sensitive consumers trade down from full-service dining and fast-casual lunches to less pricey combo meals at McDonald's or Burger King. The restaurant industry is already anticipating that the latest wave of tariffs will mean higher menu prices for diners. \"The biggest concerns for restaurant operators — from community restaurants to national brands — are that tariffs will hike food and packaging costs and add uncertainty to managing availability, while pushing prices up for consumers,\" the National Restaurant Association said in a statement. Shares of GE HealthCare, which manufactures medical imaging, ultrasound and other health devices, tumbled more than 10% on Thursday following Trump's tariff announcement. GE HealthCare produces its products in more than 20 countries and serves customers in more than 160 countries around the globe, according to its website. \"Our top priorities are to make sure patient and customer deliveries for products and services are not interrupted under any circumstances and at the best quality and cost possible,\" a GE HealthCare spokesperson told CNBC. \"This is a dynamic issue,\" the spokesperson noted. \"Our teams are working on potential mitigation plans as these trade policies evolve. We will provide an update on our next earnings call.\" Shares of Siemens Healthineers, a German med tech company, fell nearly 7% on Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Trump's aggressive and sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" affected more than 180 countries, from major trading partners to even tiny islands and remote locations. The tariff plan targeted numerous external Australian territories, including Heard and McDonald Islands, one of the most remote locations on earth, populated by seals and penguins. Norfolk Island, also an Australian territory with a population of nearly 2,000 people, was hit with some of the highest tariffs of 29%, despite Australia only facing 10% tariffs. \"I'm not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, according to The Guardian. Chipmaking stocks dropped Thursday as markets sold off after Trump revealed wide sweeping tariffs. Although the sector was excluded from the latest levies, duties targeting the sector are still coming. Semiconductors, which typically come to the U.S. in finished products such as personal computers, are also under pressure due to fears that tariffs will quell demand for technology gadgets and electronics. As of late morning trading, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF shed nearly 7%. Qorvo and Micron Technology plunged more than 12% each, while Qualcomm, Broadcom and Lam Research each dropped more than 7%. Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing slumped more than 6%, while Advanced Micro Devices fell about 5%. French President Emmanuel Macron urged companies in his country to pause investments in the U.S. after Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs. He said Trump's tariffs are a shock for international trade after his meeting at the Élysée Palace with representatives of industries affected by the heavy levies. Trump's plan sets a 10% baseline tariff across the board, while adding steep duties on many countries, including 34% on China and 20% on the European Union. Former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he believed \"the market can adjust\" to the new 10% baseline tariff on nearly all other countries, but hoped the larger tariff rates will be \"negotiated down.\" \"I do hope there's the ability to negotiate them down, because, as we've seen for certain businesses, it is going to take a long time to move that manufacturing base,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"And we've seen the stock market, particularly in certain stocks, react pretty negatively,\" he said. In another executive action signed Wednesday, Trump ended the so-called de minimis exemption on China and Hong Kong that allowed shipments worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. The trade loophole has helped Chinese cheap-goods manufacturers such as Temu and Shein flood the U.S. with inexpensive products. It will end May 2, according to the executive order. Trump had previously ended de minimis in early February but paused that move days later following concerns it could overwhelm U.S. Customs and Border Protection. On a brutal day for the stock market, shares of retailers — including Target and Nike — have been hammered particularly hard. Target, Nike, Wayfair, American Eagle Outfitters, Ugg and Hoka parent Deckers, as well as toymaker Hasbro all hit 52-week lows. Retailers are expected to face tough choices in the weeks and months ahead, as they manage higher costs from broad tariffs on imports from nations including China and Vietnam, which are major manufacturing hubs for shoes, clothing, toys, furniture and more. Some, such as Steve Madden, were slashing their sourcing from China in recent years and moving more production to other countries such as Vietnam. Yet, now, even imports from many of those alternative countries are subject to tariffs. Goods from Vietnam, for example, will face a 46% tariff. Some sectors of retail are particularly exposed: Nearly a third of footwear imports in the U.S. came from Vietnam in 2023, the most recent full-year data available, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, an industry trade group. Barclays retail analyst Seth Sigman said retailers will have a hard time absorbing all of the steep additional costs or sharing them with vendors. \"Unfortunately, some of it will result in higher prices,\" he said. CNBC's senior economics reporter Steve Liesman and on-air editor Rick Santelli held an impromptu debate about the effect of Trump's tariffs on global trade. The spirited exchange on \"Squawk Box\" followed an appearance from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Stellantis is idling production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico due to tariffs. Roughly 900 U.S.-represented employees at supporting plants will be temporarily laid off in addition to roughly 4,500 hourly workers at the Canadian plant. Workers at the plant in Mexico will still report to the plant but will not produce vehicles due to their contract terms, according to a company spokeswoman. The downtime starts Monday and will last for two weeks at the automaker's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, and the entire month of April at its Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico. \"We are continuing to assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on our operations, but also have decided to take some immediate actions, including temporarily pausing production at some of our Canadian and Mexican assembly plants,\" said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis North American chief. Vice President JD Vance argued that Trump's trade agenda, coupled with its deregulatory efforts and tax-cut plans, will ultimately bring down prices. But \"we're not going to fix things overnight,\" he said in a Fox News interview Thursday morning when asked if costs will go up and for how long. He framed the situation as one in which the Trump administration was tasked with fixing \"what was left to us\" by the Biden administration. \"You don't fix that stuff overnight. We know people are struggling. We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately,\" Vance said. Many economists warn that Trump's sweeping tariff policies will raise prices and lower growth, and even some administration officials have acknowledged the import duties will cause at least temporary economic disruption. Tariffs and economic uncertainty are threatening to slow construction of new hotels by driving up building-material costs, Baird's hotel analyst says. The cost to build in the U.S. could now be as much as 10% higher because of tariffs, particularly on materials that are largely imported from China and Vietnam, Baird hotel analyst Michael Bellisario wrote. Construction of new hotels was already strained compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic because of higher costs and interest rates. \"Signings and starts could slow over the near term given heightened macroeconomic and trade policy uncertainties; projects' opening dates are likely to slip as well, in our view,\" he said in his Thursday note, adding that Hilton, Marriott and Choice Hotels International are the most exposed to U.S. construction headwinds. Hotel stocks were all sharply lower in morning trading, and airline stocks, already battered this year, also fell. United was down more than 12% while American and Delta were each down more than 8%. Tariffs and economic weakness could add to both leisure and corporate bookings, while duties are set to drive up the cost of new aircraft. President Trump's son Eric Trump says the first countries to negotiate a trade deal with his father \"will win,\" as he warned the world not to be among the last nations to cut such a deal. \"I wouldn’t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,\" Eric wrote in a post on social media site X. \"The first to negotiate will win — the last will absolutely lose. I have seen this movie my entire life,\" he wrote. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" brushed aside the idea of countries winning exemptions from new tariffs on some products. \"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said. \"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick brushed aside the idea that some imports from certain countries will win exemptions from the new U.S. tariffs. \"I don't think the word 'exemption' is going to be a factor. I don't think that's such a thing,\" Lutnick said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"I think what there's going to be is a world of fairness. Let's go try to figure out ways for the world to treat us more fairly and more properly,\" he said. Lutnick also said other countries would be making a mistake if they impose their own reciprocal tariffs on the U.S. in retaliation. \"I don't think it's effective in the world to retaliate,\" Lutnick said. \"I mean, those things are silly.\" New tariffs will raise the price of shoes that Americans buy and lead to cheaper-quality merchandise, says a major trade group. Trump's tariff policy \"is catastrophic for American families,\" said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. The massive new import duties will hit footwear-producing nations such as Vietnam and China especially hard. \"Our industry is already dealing with inflationary pressures, and this move will force families to think twice before making a purchase,\" Priest said in a statement. The tariffs will \"drive-up costs, reduce product quality, and weaken consumer confidence,\" he added. Nearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group. About 37% of footwear imports came from China in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman wrote on social media site X, \"Sometimes the best strategy in a negotiation is convincing the other side that you are crazy.\" Ackman, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election, is a frequent defender of the president on social media. He argued in a prior X post Wednesday that other countries should not retaliate against the new U.S. tariffs. Citing a \"changing economy\" and its position as the No. 1 U.S. producer of cars and trucks, Ford said it is putting most of its vehicles on sale. The automaker is offering employee pricing to all U.S. customers from April 3 to June 2. The promotion excludes some large vehicles such as the Ford Raptor, the 2025 Expedition and Navigator SUVs and Super Duty trucks. \"We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans,\" the company said in a statement. \"We have the retail inventory to do this and a lot of choice for customers that need a vehicle.\" U.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in higher than expected as consumers flocked to buy cars ahead of auto tariffs taking effect, which many expect will lead to higher vehicle prices. The White House on Wednesday listed tariff rates for 180 countries that, in most cases, were roughly half of what the Trump administration claims each country has \"charged\" the U.S. It didn't take long for market observers to try and reverse engineer the formula — to confusing results. Many observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries. Such methodology does not necessarily align with the conventional approach to calculate tariffs and would imply the U.S. would have only looked at the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services. The U.S. also appeared to have applied a 10% levy for regions where it is running a trade surplus. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has since laid out its approach, including a formula, on its website that appeared somewhat similar to the online chatter, barring a few differences. Trump quickly declared his \"reciprocal\" tariff rollout a success. \"THE OPERATION IS OVER!\" Trump wrote in an all-caps Truth Social post. \"THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\" The new tariffs have not yet taken effect. Trump's 25% auto tariffs are in effect, but the impacts of the new levies could take years to unfold. The tariffs are on any vehicles imported into the U.S., but even if final assembly takes place domestically, autos are made up of thousands of parts that are sourced from all across the world. That means the industry is watching and waiting to see what happens with potential upcoming tariffs on auto parts. In the near term, auto industry investors should expect continued volatility in automaker and supplier stocks, according to Wall Street analysts.

      "full_content": "Trump's new tariffs elicited threats of retaliation from foreign leaders. U.S. stocks suffered major losses on Thursday at close of the first trading session after President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,679 points, or nearly 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined almost 6%. The S&P 500 tumbled 4.8%, marking its worst trading day since 2020. The selloff hammered shares of some major multinational corporations with supply chains abroad. Nike plummeted 14%, while Apple fell 9%. E-commerce giant Amazon slid nearly 9%. Shares fell for each of the other so-called \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, dropped nearly 9%. Chipmaker Nvidia slid 7%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Trump-advisor Elon Musk, declined 5%. Shares of U.S. retailers that depend largely on imported products also tumbled, with Dollar Tree down 13% and Five Below seeing 27% losses. While Trump said the tariffs would free the U.S. from dependence on foreign goods, fears of a deepened international trade war appeared to influence the stock market reaction. During the event at the White House on Wednesday, Trump unveiled a sweeping set of baseline tariffs on all trading partners and what he described as \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S. \"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" he said. The president announced the measures would include a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all trading partners and, further, more targeted punitive levies on certain countries, including China, the European Union and Taiwan. Trump held up a chart with a list of nations and what the new U.S. tariffs against them will be. At the top was China, which Trump said was set to be hit with a 34% tariff rate as he claimed it charged the United States 67%. The 34% reciprocal rate for China is in addition to a previous 20% tariff Trump slapped on the nation -- bringing the effective tariff rate on one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners to 54% total. While the longstanding effects of Trump's newly minted tariffs stand to be seen, some experts told ABC News ahead of Wednesday that the measures could threaten economic growth and employment since duties slapped on imports risk increasing costs for businesses that rely on raw materials from abroad. \"If both businesses and consumers start to worry and pull back their spending, that is what can tip the U.S. over into a recession,\" Kara Reynolds, an economist at American University, previously told ABC News. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, described the tariffs as \"the fodder for an economic downturn.\" ABC News' Max Zahn contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

      "full_content": "The chairman of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee said he regrets choosing the F-35 for his country, citing fears that the US may threaten to cease support for the fighter. \"As one of the decision-makers behind Denmark's purchase of F-35s, I regret it,\" Rasmus Jarlov, a member of parliament for the center-right Conservative People's Party, wrote on social media on Wednesday. Jarlov was addressing rumors that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II may have a \"kill-switch\" that allows Washington to remotely disable F-35s purchased by US allies. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the stealth fighter does not have such a feature. But the Danish MP isn't convinced. \"We obviously cannot take your word for it,\" Jarlov wrote in his post. He added that the US could scupper Copenhagen's use of the F-35 just by stopping the supply of spare parts — a similar dilemma that Ukraine faced when Washington temporarily paused military aid. \"I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse,\" wrote Jarlov, who is also his party's spokesperson for his stance on Greenland's affairs. Jarlov further accused the US of wanting \"to strengthen Russia and weaken Europa.\" \"Therefore, buying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible,\" he said. \"I encourage our friends and allies to do the same,\" Jarlov added. Denmark announced in 2016 that it was spending about $3 billion on 27 F-35s to replace its aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. Jarlov was serving as Denmark's defense committee chairman at the time. Copenhagen has received 17 of its orders so far. In a statement to Business Insider, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company \"values our enduring partnership with the Royal Danish Air Force and is committed to strengthening that partnership into the future.\" \"The pressure-tested F-35 program recently surpassed 1 million flight hours across 16 military services flying the aircraft,\" they said. \"We are committed to helping our customers strengthen their airpower and security with the F-35,\" they added. \"As part of our government contracts, we deliver all system infrastructure and data required for all F-35 customers to sustain the aircraft.\" His comments come as President Donald Trump has said that he wants to buy or annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that's rich in minerals and can provide the US with a strategic location near the Arctic. Leaders in both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly resisted Trump's statements, saying their governments had no interest in the territory coming under US administration or rule. \"There is no threat from China against Greenland and China has no presence in Greenland,\" Jarlov wrote on Sunday. \"The only threat against Greenland is the USA.\" Meanwhile, Second Lady Usha Vance, White House national security advisor Mike Waltz, and the Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are expected to visit Greenland on Thursday. Denmark isn't the only country reconsidering its defense reliance on US exports. Leaders in Portugal and Canada have also said they are reviewing their willingness to buy the F-35 amid the geopolitical tensions between the US and its allies. Canada's defense minister, Bill Blair, said his country may be seeking alternatives to the F-35 over concerns of hostility from Washington, which launched steep tariffs against Canadian and Mexican goods earlier this month. Meanwhile, Portugal's outgoing defense minister, Nuno Melo, told local media that his country \"cannot ignore the geopolitical environment in our choices\" on possibly buying the F-35. At least 19 governments, including the UK, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Canada, Australia, and Israel, have agreed to purchase the F-35. The F-35 is one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, and while it has several competitors, its stealth features have been dominant in the market. Other planes considered adjacent or similar in capability are China's Chengdu J-20 and the French Dassault Rafale, which a British think tank said has recently surged in popularity as US ties with its allies fray. South Korea is also developing the KF-21 Boramae, but its stealth systems are expected to be less advanced than the F-35's. The State Department, which oversees foreign sales of US weapons, and Jarlov did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.

      "full_content": "North Korea’s scamming, thieving, and AI-abusing fake IT workers are increasingly targeting European employers. The hermit kingdom (DPRK) runs a corps of operatives who apply for remote tech jobs and, if they get them, funnel their salaries to Kim Jong Un’s coffers. Some also run malware on company computers, steal their employers’ data, then demand ransom payments. Many just do a bad job – sometimes for several employers at a time – so they can be paid multiple salaries. The workers submit impressive CVs and, if they score an interview, try to disguise their accents and appearance. Claiming their webcam is broken, and therefore being unable to appear in interviews, is a favourite tactic. So is using generative AI to create portraits, or even answers in interviews. Sometimes the fake workers slip up after they get a job, by asking that company laptops be sent to an address that doesn’t match the one used in their applications. That can be a sign they’ve recruited a local facilitator who will keep the laptop connected to the grid and the net. The North Koreans then use VPNs to connect to the employer-provided laptops, and make sure they work – or appear to be working – the appropriate local hours. Facilitators also help to shift salaries to Pyongyang. The scam is sophisticated: Even infosec businesses have interviewed and hired North Korean techies. A Tuesday post penned by Jamie Collier, lead adviser at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, reports “an increase of active operations in Europe” by such workers. “DPRK IT workers' activity across multiple countries now establishes them as a global threat,” the post states. “While the United States remains a key target, over the past months, DPRK IT workers have encountered challenges in seeking and maintaining employment in the country. This is likely due to increased awareness of the threat through public reporting, United States Department of Justice indictments, and right-to-work verification challenges,” the post states. “These factors have instigated a global expansion of IT worker operations, with a notable focus on Europe,” Collier added. Google, and un-named partners, have spotted North Korean IT workers “seeking employment in Germany and Portugal\" and also found \"login credentials for user accounts of European job websites and human capital management platforms.” Investigators also found “fabricated personas, including resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and residences in Slovakia, as well as instructions for navigating European job sites.” “One document provided specific guidance on seeking employment in Serbia, including the use of a Serbian time zone during communications. Info on how to acquire false passports was also found. presumably so the fake techies can provide credentials that allow them to establish a right to work or open bank accounts. The North Korean operatives sought work on platforms including Upwork, Telegram, and Freelancer. Some sought payment in cryptocurrency, or through services like TransferWise and Payoneer. Google also thinks its found evidence of sophisticated facilitators in the UK. “One incident involved a DPRK IT worker using facilitators located in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Notably, a corporate laptop, ostensibly intended for use in New York, was found to be operational in London, indicating a complex logistical chain,” Collier wrote. The Googler thinks the fake workers are now targeting companies that operate a Bring Your Own Device (BOYD) policy, because if they can use their own hardware it’s unlikely corporate management tools can touch it. BYOD also means employers don’t need to send workers a laptop, so there’s no postal address that investigators can use to start probing a worker if things go pear-shaped. Google thinks investigations will be needed, because it’s also seen North Korean fakers increasingly targeting larger employers and more often attempting extortion. “In these incidents, recently fired IT workers threatened to release their former employers’ sensitive data or to provide it to a competitor. This data included proprietary data and source code for internal projects,” Collier wrote, before suggesting the increase in extortion attempts may be linked to increased US action against fake workers that make them desperate to maintain their ill-gotten revenues. Avoiding this scam isn’t easy, because the perps are sophisticated, but the FBI has issued guidance about how to spot fake North Korean techies. Telltale signs include evading in-person meetings, changing preferred payment methods on freelance work platforms, and online profiles that don’t include an image. ® Send us news",

      "full_content": "A Houston janitor was sentenced to six years in prison for urinating in women's water bottles, resulting in one of them contracting herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), police said. Lucio Diaz, 53, pleaded guilty on March 18 to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon stemming from multiple incidents that occurred on Sept. 26, 2022, at a medical building, Harris County court records say. According to a complaint filed in October 2022, multiple women accused Diaz of using his bodily fluids as a deadly weapon when he urinated in their water bottles. A $1 million lawsuit was filed by Houston-based law firm Abraham Watkins on behalf of 13 women in 2023 against Diaz, his employers and his supervisors, KPRC and ABC13 reported. USA TODAY contacted Abraham Watkins, who said they are working on providing a statement. The initial woman who reported Diaz's behavior said everything began on Aug. 30, 2022, when she noticed the water coming from the medical building's employee water dispenser had a \"funny taste and smell to it,\" according to the complaint. The woman would immediately dump the water out and throw her bottle away, the court document said. She then began bringing her own 16-ounce bottle to work, which she would often leave on her desk for the next day due to her not being able to drink it all, the complaint reads. According to the complaint, the woman then told police that after a few days went by, she noticed her personal water bottle randomly \"smelled nasty,\" but she could not figure out why. This prompted her to trash her water bottle, and to go buy another one, the document states. It was not until Sept. 22, 2022, that she realized urine was in her water bottle after a colleague brought it to her attention, the complaint says. Once a urinalysis test determined the water in the woman's bottle tested positive for urine, another woman in the same building said the same thing happened to her, according to the court document. To catch whoever was urinating in women's bottles, the initial woman set up a hidden camera under her computer and left her water bottle capped before heading home on Sept. 26, the complaint reads. Shortly after the woman left, the camera caught Diaz opening her water bottle, unzipping his pants and putting his penis inside the bottle before closing and placing it back on her desk, the court filing says. The woman reported the incident to Houston police on Sept. 27 and gave the officers two different water bottles as evidence, one containing urine and the other one that Diaz put his penis inside, the complaint reads. When police officers confronted Diaz, he admitted to sticking his penis inside the woman's water bottle on two separate occasions, according to the court document. When officers asked Diaz why he urinated in the bottles, the janitor said he did it because he knew the woman would drink it the next day, the complaint says. On Oct. 10, 2022, a separate woman who was victimized by Diaz told police that she tested positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 and chlamydia after drinking from her urine-contaminated water bottle, according to the court document.",

      "full_content": "The Chinese military said Tuesday it had launched joint exercises involving its army, navy, air force and rocket force around Taiwan as a “stern warning,” days after US defense chief Pete Hegseth vowed to counter “China’s aggression” on his first visit to Asia.\n     \n            China’s armed forces will “close in” on the self-governing island from “multiple directions” in the drills and practice maneuvers including “assault on maritime and ground targets” and “blockade on key areas and sea lanes” to test joint operations capabilities of the troops, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)’s Eastern Theater Command said in a statement on social media.\n     \n            “It is a stern warning and forceful deterrence against ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” the statement added.\n     \n            China’s latest military exercises come as Taiwan is looking on nervously as US President Donald Trump transforms Washington’s global relationships with his mercantilist “America First” foreign policy, discarding decades-old guarantees towards Europe and pushing long-standing Asian allies and partners to pay more for US protection.\n     \n            Meanwhile, officials close to Trump have repeatedly emphasized the need for the US to focus its attention and resources on countering China’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.\n     \n            For Taiwan, a democracy of some 23 million people that sits just 80 miles from China at its nearest point, the drills are the latest reminder of the threat that comes from its giant Communist Party-run neighbor, which claims the island as its own and has vowed to seize it by force if necessary.\n     \n            Taiwan officials have condemned the drills as “reckless” and “irresponsible.”\n     \n            “It came without justification, violates international laws and is totally unacceptable. Democracies need to condemn China for being a troublemaker,” Joseph Wu, secretary-general of Taiwan’s National Security Council, said in a post on social platform X.\n     \n            The Taiwanese Defense Ministry said it detected 71 Chinese military aircraft and 13 PLA navy vessels near Taiwan, as well as a group of warships led by China’s first domestically built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, in the West Pacific.\n     \n            The ministry added that its troops are on “high vigilance” to respond to the situation.\n     \n            Taiwan’s military dispatched its own aircraft and ships, and deployed land-based missile systems to closely monitor the situation and respond appropriately, the island’s Defense Ministry said in a statement about the Shandong aircraft carrier group.\n     \n            The Eastern Theater Command released a video of the PLA taking part in the drills on Tuesday, showing Chinese frigates sailing, military aircraft taking off and missiles being erected into launch position.\n     \n            Later in the day, it said it organized naval and air force formations to conduct exercises in the northern, southern and eastern waters surrounding Taiwan, in coordination with conventional missiles and long-range rocket artillery. It did not say how long the exercises would last.\n     \n            In Taiwan, government officials and experts view the Chinese drills as a signal to the Trump administration, where several key cabinet officials are hawkish on China, in particular Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n     \n            During his first trip to Asia as US defense secretary last week, Hegseth vowed to enhance America’s military alliance with the Philippines to “reestablish deterrence” to counter “China’s aggression” in the Indo-Pacific region, and called Japan an “indispensable partner in deterring communist Chinese military aggression,” including across the Taiwan Strait.\n     \n            An internal analysis by the Taiwan government cited Hegseth’s visit as among the “external reasons” for China’s latest drills.\n     \n            “They have reaffirmed the importance of security and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and confirmed that the US is shifting its security focus to the Indo-Pacific region. This has put great pressure on Beijing’s intentions,” according to the analysis, shared with CNN by a senior Taiwanese national security official.\n     \n            “Faced with upcoming US-China trade talks and the expected measures against China, Beijing has opted for restraint to avoid actions that could be seen as directly confronting the US. Taiwan serves as the perfect pretext, prompting Beijing to launch these military drills immediately after the US Secretary of Defense left Asia,” the analysis added.\n     \n            Su Tzu-yun, a director at the Institute for National Defense Security Research in Taiwan, said unlike the two “Joint Sword-2024” military drills China conducted last year, the latest exercises came as a “surprise” on Tuesday morning.\n     \n            “I think Beijing is trying to show its signal to Washington,” Su said.\n     \n            On Tuesday, China’s coast guard said it also launched “law-enforcement patrols” in waters surrounding Taiwan, carrying out drills including interception and detention of “unwarranted vessels.”\n     \n            The Chinese military has ramped up regular patrols as well as military exercises in the air and waters around Taiwan, part of a broader assertiveness of China’s territorial claims under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n     \n            Major exercises often serve as means for Beijing to express displeasure with the island – as well as to better understand how Taiwan monitors and responds to military pressure from China.\n     \n            China’s military has in recent years launched drills encircling Taiwan and simulating a blockade of the island – one of the strategies that experts say could be used if Beijing ultimately decides to move to take control using military might.\n     \n            Zhang Chi, a professor at the PLA’s National Defense University in Beijing, said Tuesday’s drills don’t have a specific codename because such military exercises have increasingly become routine.\n     \n            “This largely indicates that the exercises we see today have become a new normal for the PLA and the Eastern Theater Command – it’s routine for them,” he told China’s state broadcaster CCTV.\n \n            Beijing has repeatedly accused Taiwan’s leaders of seeking “independence,” and views Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te as a “separatist,” launching large-scale drills days after Lai’s inauguration last year.\n     \n            On Tuesday, the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command released a series of propaganda videos after announcing the latest drills, including one that depicts Lai as a green cartoon bug and calls him a “parasite” hollowing out the island.\n     \n            Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, called the military exercises “a resolute warning to the Lai Ching-te administration’s rampant provocations for ‘independence.’”\n     \n            Lai, who has long been a champion of Taiwan’s sovereignty, has called on China to cease its intimidation, but he has also spoken frequently of the importance of maintaining “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”\n     \n            Polls consistently show people in Taiwan, a thriving and outspoken democracy, have no desire to be ruled by China, an authoritarian one-party state.\n     \n            The latest drills follow a series of incidents that have ratcheted up tensions across the Taiwan Strait, including Taipei’s detention in late February of a cargo ship crewed by Chinese nationals it was investigating for allegedly cutting an undersea internet cable in the second such incident in a period of months.\n     \n            Last month, Lai called China a “foreign hostile force” and ramped up national security measures to combat Chinese espionage and infiltration. Days later, Taiwan deported a Chinese influencer for backing a military takeover of the island democracy by Beijing.\n     \n            Taiwan has long been seen as a potential flashpoint that could spark hot conflict between China and the United States.\n     \n            The US maintains unofficial relations with Taipei and is bound by law to provide Taiwan with weapons for its defense. Washington has long maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would come to Taiwan’s defense in the event of an incursion from China.\n     \nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

      "full_content": "Apple on Monday released visionOS 2.4, and it’s the first update to enable Apple Intelligence features in Apple Vision Pro. However, even though the update was released on the same day as iOS 18.4 – which expands AI capabilities to more languages – Apple Intelligence for Vision Pro is only available in English. In a note on Apple’s website, the company notes that the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro is only available in US English. This means that Vision Pro users must set both the system language and Siri to US English before enabling AI features. When Apple Intelligence arrived on iOS, it was also limited to US English. With iOS 18.2, Apple has expanded its AI tools to more variations of English. Now with iOS 18.4, Apple Intelligence is also available in French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese, and Spanish. The Apple Intelligence features in Vision Pro are pretty much the same as those already available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and text summarization. Apple hasn’t made any specific AI features for Vision Pro, and it doesn’t have Visual Intelligence like the iPhone. Since Vision Pro is only available in a few countries around the world, it’s understandable that Apple hasn’t rushed to add support for more languages just yet. In addition to Apple Intelligence, visionOS 2.4 adds a new Spatial Gallery app with photos, videos and spatial panoramas curated by Apple. The update also makes it easier to share a Vision Pro with a guest. You can install visionOS 2.4 by going to Settings > General > Software Update. It’s worth noting that Apple Vision Pro is currently available in Australia, Canada, China mainland, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, the UAE, the UK, and the US.

      "full_content": "Donald Trump has called tariffs the “most beautiful word” in the dictionary. He’s said they will make Americans “rich” and restructure the economy for the better. Standing in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, with political and business leaders around the world watching closely, Trump bet his faith in tariffs against the hard reality of economics as he launched what is expected to be one of the single largest increases in U.S. trade barriers in a century. Advertisement Advertisement Trump announced he was signing an executive order “instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal—that means they do it to us and we do it to them.” In practice, the White House said that will translate into a new 10 percent tariff on all imported goods, and additional import taxes on 60 other countries. Those additional tariffs vary and were determined by looking at the rules in those countries around U.S. exports, according to the White House. Trump’s new tariff regime will be on top of various tariffs the U.S. already has in place, and ones Trump had already set in motion targeting imports of cars, steel and aluminum. The reciprocal tariffs would go into effect Thursday, he said. Speaking to staff, cabinet secretaries and reporters gathered outside the West Wing, Trump gave a rambling and sometimes contradictory explanation of his tariff plan. He said that his administration would calculate what a country charges the U.S. imports through tariffs, “non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating” and would charge the country half of that in a flat rate. The new tariffs were not a “full reciprocal,” he said. “I would like to have done that.” Reading from a large chart, he said goods coming from China, for example, would be charged a duty of 34%, goods from the European Union would carry a 20% tariff, Vietnam would have 35% and Taiwan 32%. An eight-page chart handed out to reporters in the Rose Garden listed 60 countries as being charged rates above the baseline of 10%. Trump had previously announced a separate 25% tariff on all auto imports that is slated to kick in on April 3. He’s imposed 20% tariffs on all imports coming from China and put in place 25% duties on steel and aluminum. He had previously delayed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada over his accusation that those countries weren’t doing enough to stop fentanyl from coming to the U.S. That delayed tariff kicks in Wednesday and will be stacked on top of the new sweeping tariffs Trump announced. Trump has called the day of his announcement “Liberation Day” and billed it as a moment he is remaking the American economy.  He promised that income from the new tariffs would reduce taxes and pay down U.S. debt. American businesses have struggled in recent weeks to plan ahead as Trump’s tariff threats have injected so much uncertainty into their supply chains. Stock indices have dipped. Expectations of inflation have soared. Investors are rattled. Last month, JPMorgan Chase lowered its prediction for GDP growth by 0.3% because of the uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy. Leading economists say the costs of tariffs are mostly passed on to consumers. On the campaign trail last year, Trump often disputed that. More recently, he has said Americans will have to brace for some temporary economic pain in order to strengthen the U.S. economy over the longer term. But he didn’t mention that on Wednesday. Trump's announcement will test his support among Republicans in Congress—all of whom will be hearing about the fallout from their constituents. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley expressed concerns about how the new tariffs will impact farmers in his state. As an example of the ripple effect, he pointed to potash, a fertilizer from Canada that is essential for soybean production. “If that goes up by 25% that's going to hurt the family farm already not making money,” he tells TIME. —WITH REPORTING BY NIK POPLI",

      "full_content": "The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models. That's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia. Huang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it. Here's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background. Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington. His uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. Huang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland. Before founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985. At a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation. In 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU. Today, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models. Interest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights. In one notable milestone, Nvidia's market cap passed $3 trillion in 2024 to briefly overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company. Huang's net worth is $105.4 billion, according to Forbes. Huang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day. Current and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes. Huang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays. He has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share. Huang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product. Nvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang. Priem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia. After Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023. Huang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company. Huang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins. He has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Huang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award. In past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people. As of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.",

      "full_content": "The Marine Corps is known for its famous shooting and drill teams. Now, the service is adding a new competitive, precision weapons team to its ranks — a drone team. \"Today's battlefield is changing rapidly, and we must adapt just as quickly,\" said Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion. Tavizon will oversee the newly created Marine Corps Attack Drone Team, a leading part of the service's efforts to catch up with advancements in drone warfare overseas, a Marine Corps statement said. \"The Marine Corps Attack Drone Team will ensure that our warfighters remain at the forefront of precision drone employment, providing a critical advantage in future conflicts,\" he said. \"By leveraging emerging technologies and refining drone employment tactics, we are ensuring that Marines remain agile, adaptive, and lethal in the modern battlespace,\" Tavizon added. This effort isn't coming out of the blue, and arrives as modern combat is increasingly defined by unmanned weapon systems. The Marine Corps said that \"the creation of MCADT comes in response to the rapid proliferation of armed first-person view drone technology and tactics observed in modern conflicts, particularly in Eastern Europe,\" a clear reference to the Ukraine war where uncrewed combat is prolific. The new drone team will be based with the service's Warfighting Laboratory and Weapons Training Battalion, with design based rooted in the Corps' competitive shooting team, a group that has long guided training development for the rest of the force. That the service has chosen to house its couple warfare efforts with its prestigious shooting team may highlight just how seriously it's taking drone warfare. The Corps considers the rifle to be the bedrock weapon for all Marines regardless of their job, part of the service's \"every Marine a rifleman\" mentality. Housing the drone team with the Weapons Training Battalion, the Corps' ultimate repository of small arms knowledge, could signal how drastically the service is trying to shift to the future. \"Right now, our focus is on rapidly building proficiency by sending Marines to a variety of training courses and increasing hands-on familiarization,\" Tavizon said. \"Our goal is to ensure they can not only operate these systems effectively but also integrate them seamlessly into a team.\" The Corps explained that it's using different small drone systems to facilitate \"precision strikes up to 20 kilometers for under $5,000 —offering a more cost-effective and capable alternative to traditional weapons systems.\" The team is set to represent the Corps in drone competitions around the world, with its first competition slated for this summer at the National Drone Association's Military Drone Crucible Championship, a competition meant to simulate drone usage in modern combat. \"MCADT will execute tactical missions using FPVs and small UAS in realistic scenarios designed to simulate modern combat,\" the Corps said, referring to the kind of first-person-view drones and uncrewed aerial systems that have been used extensively in Ukraine. The new attack team will also be responsible for integrating key lessons learned from drone warfare overseas. The drone team's establishment comes as the US military continues to tackle important problems.  First, the Pentagon is figuring out how to quickly procure rapidly changing technology, like drones, which is a significant change from the notoriously cumbersome military-industrial complex that ballooned throughout the Global War on Terror.  Second, the services are trying to apply lessons learned from relevant conflicts overseas, such as the war in Ukraine, to help shape plans for future warfare. Ukraine continues to serve as a sort of test bed for drone experimentation that militaries across the globe are watching closely. Ukrainian and Russian forces are grappling with terrifying advancements, including drones with mounted shotguns, others that release molten thermite to pour over enemy positions, and drones piloted with AI assistance to boost strike accuracy. Pacific nations are also taking note of Ukrainian developments— a Taiwan company recently announced the creation of a new \"sea drone\" designed to fire small torpedoes or ram into targets inspired by Ukrainian attacks on Russia's Black Sea Fleet.",

      "full_content": "China continues a second day of war games and military drills around Taiwan, including simulated attacks on key targets. Chinese military drills around Taiwan continue for the second day China’s military said it has simulated attacks on high-value targets in Taiwan, including ports and energy facilities, as it carried out “live-fire” military drills around the self-ruled island on the second day of war-game exercises. The drills on Wednesday, part of an operation titled “Strait Thunder-2025A”, were conducted in the middle and southern parts of the Taiwan Strait as well as the East China Sea, the military said. “Long-range live-fire drills” were carried out in order to practise hitting “simulated targets of key ports and energy facilities” during the exercises, the military said. The aim was to “test the troops’ capabilities” in areas such as “blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets”, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman of the Chinese military’s Eastern Theatre Command. China’s Shandong aircraft carrier was also deployed in the drills, testing the ability to “blockade” Taiwan by integrating naval and air power, the Eastern Theatre Command said. China’s military published a video of what it said were the live-fire drills that showed rockets, rather than ballistic missiles, being launched and hitting targets on land, and an animation of explosions over Taiwanese cities including Tainan, Hualien and Taichung, all home to military bases and ports. Taiwan’s President William Lai Ching-te condemned the drills while the island’s defence ministry said China had deployed 21 warships around the island, including the Shandong carrier group, and 71 aircraft and four coastguard vessels on Tuesday. “China’s blatant military provocations not only threaten peace in the #Taiwan Strait but also undermine security in the entire region, as evidenced by drills near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines & the SCS [South China Sea]. We strongly condemn China’s escalatory behaviour,” Taiwan’s Presidential Office said in a post on X. On Wednesday, Taiwan said that 76 Chinese military aircraft and 19 naval or government ships had entered waters and airspace near the island over the previous 24 hours, with 37 of the planes crossing the centre line in the 160-kilometre (110-mile) wide Taiwan Strait that forms an unofficial border with mainland China, but which Beijing refuses to acknowledge. The Shandong aircraft carrier group had also entered Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, a self-defined security area tracked by the Taiwanese military.      Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said the exercises were not the first conducted by China around Taiwan but these latest drills “show how serious Beijing is about honing their capability to blockade the island of Taiwan should they deem necessary”. “Beijing sees Taiwan, the democratic ruled island, as a breakaway Chinese province, and President Xi Jinping has said time and time again, that whether by peaceful means or by force, it will be unified again with mainland China,” Yu said. “Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te has condemned the drills. He says, this is only demonstrating that China is a troublemaker in this region,” Yu added. The drills are expected to continue until Thursday night and China’s Maritime Safety Administration has announced that an area off the northern part of the eastern province of Zhejiang, more than 500km (310 miles) from Taiwan, will be closed for shipping due to military operations.",

      "full_content": "A North Dakota jury on Wednesday found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The jury found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims and awarded Dallas-based Energy Transfer and subsidiary Dakota Access more than $650 million in damages. The lawsuit accused Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. of defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts. Advertisement Advertisement Greenpeace said earlier that a large award to the pipeline company would threaten to bankrupt the environmental group. Following the nine-person jury’s verdict, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser said the organization’s work “is never going to stop.” The independent global campaigning network has been fighting for a wide array of environmental issues for more than half a century and has a long history of contentious legal battles. Here are some things to know: Environmental activists founded the group in Vancouver, Canada, in 1971. The network’s first action was to work to stop more nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian island chain in southwest Alaska. They took a ship toward the island to “bear witness,\" which is a Quaker protest tradition, but were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, according to the Greenpeace website. The U.S. later opted to abandon their nuclear testing grounds on the island, marking Greenpeace's first major victory. During initial work to stop the nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka, Canadian ecologist Bill Darnell was leaving one of the group’s meetings when someone held up two fingers and said “peace!” according to Greenpeace’s website. Darnell, who is considered a founding member of Greenpeace, replied: “Let’s make it a Green Peace.” The name was condensed into one word so it could fit on buttons for the group’s first fundraiser. Greenpeace describes itself as the largest environmental campaigning organization in the world. It is made up of dozens of independent national or regional organizations in more than 55 countries, according to its website. Its work to preserve and restore valuable ecosystems and push back on fossil fuel corporations is centered on nonviolent action. Its protests have ranged from efforts to stop Shell from drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic to demonstrations to put an end to France’s atmospheric tests in the South Pacific to campaigns to conserve Canada’s coastal rainforest. Greenpeace and its activists have also been the target of charges and lawsuits, including in 2023 when four activists were arrested for scaling the country estate of former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and draping it in black fabric to protest his plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. They were later cleared of criminal charges. It was also one of the environmental groups that filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Willow oil project in Alaska in recent years. Greenpeace is an independent network that does not take money from governments, corporations or political parties, according to its website. Its funding comes from individual contributions, along with foundation grants. In 2023, Greenpeace USA had about $40 million in revenue and support and about $38 million in expenses, according to its online financial statement. Its website says it does not consider anyone a permanent friend or enemy. “If your government or company is willing to change, we will work with you to achieve your aims, its website states. “Reverse course, and we will be back.”",

      "full_content": "For months in early 2024, conservatives like myself tried to sound the alarm on President Joe Biden's declining physical and mental health. It was obvious that he was unwell. Yet, Democrats and much of the legacy news media ignored that reality and even attacked those of us who were willing to speak the truth. They claimed we were fabricating tales and spreading baseless conspiracy theories. Now, the narrative has changed dramatically. Journalists are publishing books and news articles detailing not only Biden's poor health but also an orchestrated cover-up inside the White House. According to one of the books, even one of Biden's closest former aides now admits that the commander in chief was \"out of it\" last year as he attempted to run for reelection. This is one of the biggest scandals of my adult life. Now we know that Biden's inner circle deliberately misled the American people in an election year about the incumbent president's ability to serve a second term. We also know that journalists were far too passive, at best, in reporting revelations that Americans needed to know before the election. Opinion: Republicans don't need Trump to run again. Vance is ready to take the lead. Politico reported last week that at least four books will be published in the next few weeks that provide new details about Biden's failing health and the conspiracy to cover it up. One of those books, \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” by NBC News' Jonathan Allen and The Hill's Amie Parnes, includes incredible details about Biden's poor health while he was still in office. The authors report that Democratic leaders were worried that Biden could not win another election and had “hush-hush talks” discussing his potential withdrawal from the race as early as 2023. Biden did withdraw, but not until July 2024, after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump. The most damning part of \"Fight\" is the revelation that Vice President Kamala Harris' aides were so concerned about the president's health that they \"strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office.\" The authors report that Jamal Simmons, the vice president's communications director, drew up a “death-pool roster” of federal judges who could swear in Harris as president if Biden died. In “Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History,\" author Chris Whipple details Biden's serious mental and physical decline. “I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden’s final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story,\" Whipple told Politico. After extensive reporting, Whipple, a former \"60 Minutes\" producer, came to the conclusion that Democrats were in deep denial about Biden's condition: “I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.” Ron Klain, a longtime aide to Biden and his former White House chief of staff, helped the president prepare for his fateful debate with Trump last year. Klain told Whipple that Biden “didn’t know what Trump had been saying and couldn’t grasp what the back and forth was.” Klain also described how Biden “didn’t really understand what his argument was on inflation” and “had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job.” Opinion: I'm tired of being mocked and hated because I'm a conservative woman Biden didn't just run for reelection, quit and pass the torch to Harris. He was the sitting president, who was in serious decline and was surrounded by people who knew it but stayed silent. A Washington Post review of \"Fight\" notes, \"So much fresh material, so many bruised egos, so many scores to settle. ... Every one of them saw the wreck coming, of course, in the instant the train lurched out of the station, but no one would listen. Now, at long last, they can tell it all.\" Opinion newsletter: Sign up for our newsletter on conservative values, family and religion from columnist Nicole Russell. Get it delivered to your inbox. But Americans deserved to be told the truth at least a year ago, not months after the 2024 election. The fact that they weren't is a scandal not only for Democrats but much of the legacy media as well. Democratic insiders knew that concerns about the president's ability to continue serving were serious. Journalists who covered the president had ample evidence to suggest those concerns were valid. Only now, a year too late, are they finally telling us the truth. Nicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

      "full_content": "The president also announced a China tariffs increase to 125%. United States stocks closed with major gains on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs, marking a reversal from days earlier when Trump said the policy would \"never change.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2,962 points, or 7.8%, marking the index's best day since 2020. The S&P 500 jumped 9.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.1%. The spike in the three major stock indexes erased much of the losses suffered in the aftermath of sweeping new tariffs issued by Trump a week ago. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the higher tariffs for most countries that he announced last week, while maintaining a 10% baseline tariff across the board. Speaking later in the day, Trump said he enacted the policy reversal because people were \"getting yippy\" amid the tariff fallout. \"I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy. You know, we're getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,\" he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. Even after the rally, markets remained lower than where they stood before Trump rolled out his \"reciprocal\" tariff plan at a Rose Garden event on April 2. Trump on Wednesday also announced additional tariffs on China, increasing the cumulative tariffs on Chinese goods from 104% to 125%. The escalation came in response to a fresh round of tariffs from China that raised levies on U.S. goods to 84%. European Union countries also backed the European Commission's proposal to push back on Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum with a set of countermeasures on Wednesday. In Europe, key indices dropped on opening Wednesday. The British FTSE 100 dropped by 2.2%, Germany's Dax index dropped 2.3%, France's CAC 40 fell by 2.4% and Spain's Ibex index was down 2%. The pan-European STOXX index was down 2.6%. The market rally followed tumult on Tuesday, when U.S. stocks closed lower, marking a major reversal from a rally that sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq up more than 4% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 320 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.1%. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, putting the index on the brink of a bear market, a term that indicates a 20% drop from a previous peak. The move lower on Tuesday resumed a selloff that stretched back to Trump's tariff announcement April 2. Since then, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have each fallen more than 12%. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "full_content": "The UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) is launching an appeal to help the thousands of people injured and displaced as a result of last week's powerful earthquake which struck Myanmar and the wider region. Made up of 15 UK aid agencies, including the British Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the Children, the DEC is asking the British public for donations before the monsoon season arrives in two months. More than 2,800 people have died and more than 4,500 have been injured, according to the leaders of Myanmar's military government, with figures expected to rise. The charities say shelter, medicine, food, water and cash support is \"urgently needed\". Baroness Chapman, minister for development, said public donations to the DEC appeal would be matched pound-for-pound by the government, up to the value of £5m. DEC's chief executive Saleh Saeed said the situation was \"ever more critical.\" \"Funds are urgently needed to help families access life-saving humanitarian aid following this catastrophe,\" he said. Multiple international aid agencies and foreign governments have dispatched personnel and supplies to quake-hit regions. Myanmar was already facing a severe humanitarian crisis before the 7.7 magnitude earthquake due to the ongoing civil war there, with the DEC estimating a third of the population is in need of aid. The country has been gripped by violence amid the conflict between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. On Wednesday, Myanmar's military government announced a temporary ceasefire lasting until 22 April, saying it was aimed at expediting relief and reconstruction efforts.  Rebel groups had already unilaterally declared a ceasefire to support relief efforts earlier this week, but the military had refused to do the same until Wednesday's announcement. Aid workers have come under attack in Myanmar. On Tuesday night, the army opened fire at a Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies.  Nine of the charity's vehicles came under attack. The UN and some charities have accused the military junta of blocking access. The US Geological Survey's modelling estimates Myanmar's death toll could exceed 10,000, while the cost in damages to infrastructure could surpass the country's annual economic output. Roads, water services and buildings including hospitals have been destroyed, especially in Mandalay, the hard-hit city near the epicentre. In Thailand, at least 21 people have died.  The Red Cross has also issued an urgent appeal for $100m (£77m), while the UN is seeking $8m in donations for its response. \"People urgently require medical care, clean drinking water, tents, food, and other basic necessities,\" the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said on Monday. The DEC brings together 15 leading UK aid charities to provide and deliver aid to ensure successful appeals. The appeal will be broadcast on the BBC and other media outlets throughout Thursday.",

        "full_content": "A report published this week by the National Hurricane Center revealed the brutal impact of Hurricane Helene, which hit the American Southeast in late September 2024. The center reports that Hurricane Helene was the deadliest storm since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The report found that Helene “is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States (including at least 175 direct deaths),” making it the deadliest storm in 20 years. You can read the NHC’s comprehensive report here. Hurricane preparedness is critical in minimizing loss of property and life. Whether it’s boarding up windows, sandbagging homes, or simply up and leaving, getting early warnings of extreme weather is critical to mitigating damage from those storms. In Helene’s case, flash flooding (as the name suggests) happened quite suddenly, and far inland, catching many by surprise. Direct fatalities occur due to a storm’s immediate impactsâwhether it be flooding, rip currents, landslides, or falling trees. Ninety-four people died from Helene’s flooding and the resulting landslides, according to the report, with the second deadliest culprit being wind, which caused 65 direct deaths. Currently, about 10% of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration staff are either laid off or not allowed to work due to Trump administration-driven cuts whose legality is now being determined by the courts; last week, Gizmodo spoke with a meteorologist and hurricane hunter who flew through several storms, including Helene, about the situation. ‘We Just Want to Get Back to Work’: NOAA Hurricane Hunter Speaks Out After Trump’s Layoffs When Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm, it knocked out power for millions of people across the American southeast and caused flooding as far inland as Tennessee and western North Carolina. The storm plunged swathes of Georgia and the Carolinas into darkness, captured in eerie satellite images. Helene’s impacts weren’t just felt on the ground. The International Space Station’s Atmospheric Waves Experiment (AWE) captured images of gravity waves in Earth’s atmosphere, churned up by the intense storm. 2024’s hurricanes were strong and unpredictable across the board; consider Hurricane Milton, which swelled from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 event in just seven hours. The Atlantic hurricanes last season took advantage of especially moist conditionsâbreeding ground for intense storms. Helene’s death toll is dwarfed by that of Hurricane Katrina, which reportedly caused nearly 1,400 deaths, including 520 direct deaths. Many of the 565 indirect fatalities (318) were cardiovascular in nature, and 307 additional fatalities could not be definitively labeled as either directly or indirectly caused by Katrina. Hurricane season doesn’t start back up until June 30, and will run through November 30. Here’s hoping that NOAA can sort out its staffing issues before the worst comes to pass. \nDeathsHurricanehurricane heleneKatrinaStorm  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          After mass layoffs at NOAA, meteorologist Andrew Hazelton finds himself in a bureaucratic no manâs landâfired, then reinstated, but still unable to work.\n         \n          The hurricane jumped three Safford-Simpson hurricane categories in less than a day, and scientists now propose a new factor that contributed to the storm's evolution.\n         \n          NASA satellites spotted five tropical cyclones churning in the Indian and Pacific Oceans late this month, revealing different points in the storms' developments.\n         \n          Heavy hitters like Helene and Milton characterized an Atlantic storm season that was especially moist, breeding tornadoes on the coast and flood far inland.\n         \n          The Category 4 storm kicked up atmospheric swells many miles above Earth's surface.\n         \n          ...but that's not all!",

        "full_content": "After senior Trump administration members mistakenly included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a secret group chat about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen, encrypted messaging app Signal found itself at the center of a storm this week. Some commentators criticized the app, going as far to blame it for the scandal. But the whole affair that’s dubiously been dubbed “SignalGate” isn’t about Signal at all: Experts say officials shouldn’t invite untrusted contacts into sensitive chats and should only use authorized devices, platforms, and procedures when discussing top-secret military operations. In other words, the people who set up the chat made numerous mistakes, and they had nothing to do with how secure Signal is. In fact, Signal has seen its biggest-ever spike in US downloads as a result of the news. In other news linked to that Houthi group chat, national security adviser Mike Waltz—an account with the name “Michael Waltz” originally invited Goldberg to the group—left his Venmo account open to public view. As WIRED reported, a “Michael Waltz” Venmo account displayed the names of the adviser’s colleagues and friends, revealing people in Waltz’s wider social network. After WIRED reached out to the White House, the Waltz account hid its friends list. There’s more though: WIRED also discovered other Venmo accounts linked to officials in the Signal chat. Information about who officials associate with could be highly lucrative for foreign spies and hackers. Elsewhere, we reported on all the ways the White House adopting Elon Musk’s Starlink as an alternative Wi-Fi network could be bad news for network security. There are also early signs in Europe that some companies are going cold on cloud services from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as they reassess the risks of dealing with the volatile second Trump administration. And, as crossing the United States border becomes more perilous—for both citizens and visa holders—we updated our guide to keeping your digital privacy intact when you are entering the US. That’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Top US Security Officials’ Passwords and Personal Phone Numbers Discovered Online On top of SignalGate and Venmo accounts being left exposed, German news outlet Der Spiegel reported that sensitive personal information linked to several senior Trump administration security officials is easily discoverable online. Reporters from the publication found that mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and “some” passwords for top officials could be found on the internet. Using people-search engines and information contained in public data breaches, Der Spiegel discovered personal information belonging to Waltz, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense. “Most of these numbers and email addresses are apparently still in use, with some of them linked to profiles on social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn,” the news organization reported. The details were also linked to Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Signal, and WhatsApp accounts used by the officials. While millions of people have been caught up in online data breaches and use inadequate privacy settings on their online accounts, high-level government security officials are exposed to a broader and more severe range of online threats, particularly from nation-state hackers, than most people. Officials told the news organization that many of the accounts and personal details were no longer used or had been updated. However, messages Der Spiegel sent to WhatsApp and Signal accounts belonging to Waltz and Gabbard were delivered, the publication reported. Only after they approached the government for comment were some of the accounts restricted. Internet Restrictions May Hide Initial Toll of Myanmar Earthquake Damage On Friday, a huge 7.7-magnitude earthquake and aftershock hit Myanmar, with widespread damage being reported hundreds of miles away in Thailand. At the time of writing, at least 144 people have been confirmed dead with hundreds of others injured in Myanmar. As the first impacts of the devastating quake started to emerge, The New York Times reported that long-standing and widespread internet restrictions in worn-torn Myanmar were likely making it harder for news of the damage to be understood. Since the country’s military junta took power in 2021, connectivity within Myanmar has been widely disrupted or blocked. For instance in 2023, 13 out of Myanmar’s 14 states faced internet disruptions. In the wake of the earthquake, more video footage and news could be seen immediately emerging from neighbouring Thailand, experts told the Times. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Joe Freeman from Amnesty International said. The lack of connectivity may also make the recovery and humanitarian efforts harder to coordinate, once again highlighting the vital need for people to have reliable and open access to the internet. Alleged Snowflake Hacker Connor Moucka Agrees to US Extradition Last summer’s Snowflake hacking spree, where customers of the cloud storage company had their accounts targeted, was likely one of the largest mass data exfiltrations that’s publicly known. Toward the end of 2024, Canadian authorities arrested Alexander “Connor” Moucka, 26, who allegedly used online handles such as “Waifu” and “Judische,” in connection to the hacking activity. This week, Moucka consented to be extradited to the United States to face the alleged charges. According to Cyberscoop, Moucka faces 20 federal charges, including those linked to computer fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Moucka is not the only person allegedly behind the Snowflake hacking, with John Binns and Cameron Wagenius being named in indictments. It is unclear when Moucka’s extradition will take place. London Is Getting Its First Permanent Face Recognition Cameras Police forces across the UK have massively increased their use of live face recognition cameras in recent years. Use of the controversial technology has historically been temporary: mounting cameras on top of police vehicles and deploying them for specific events and set periods of time. That’s now set to change with the first permanent face recognition cameras being rolled out in London. The city’s Metropolitan Police are in the process of installing fixed cameras in Croydon, in the south of the city. “This will mean our use of LFR technology will be far more embedded as a ‘business as usual’ approach rather than relying on the availability of the LFR vans that are in high demand across London,” a police official wrote in a letter seen by The Times of London. Reportedly, the cameras will not be used continuously, only when officers are nearby to monitor potential alerts. However, privacy campaigners fear the move could be further rolled out across the city, leading to a network of permanent face recognition cameras unlike those seen in any other democratic countries.",

        "full_content": "Residential damage in Augusta caused by Hurricane Helene has reached $282m (Â£220m) The manicured grass around the entrance to Augusta National is pristine. It always is. In the suburbs which circle the home of the Masters, though, it is a different picture. Fractured trees sprawl across gardens. Rubbles of wood and brick stack high. Homes remain shattered. So do lives. When Rory McIlroy and the world's best golfers arrived in Augusta this week, along with an estimated 200,000 fans, the devastation caused by one of the United States' deadliest natural disasters was laid bare before them. In September, Hurricane Helene hit the south-eastern States - leaving death and destruction in its wake. Augusta, nicknamed 'The Garden City' because of its natural greenery, felt its mighty force. The residents are still dealing with the effects. \"There were multiple hours of 80mph winds which laid all of the forest down,\" lifelong Augusta resident Tonya Bonitatibus told BBC Sport. \"A lot of trees fell on top of houses and crushed cars â I lost my truck. But I was a lucky one.\" When Helene reached the American coast, it brought extreme winds, numerous tornadoes and flooding across several states.  According to the National Hurricane Center, Helene is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States, including at least 175 direct deaths. It was the deadliest hurricane in the US since Katrina in 2005. Florida, on the south-eastern frontier, bore the brunt of the force. But Helene quickly headed further north, engulfing South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. Augusta, which is the third most populous city in Georgia, was attacked by gusts of wind which reached 100mph through the night of 26 September - with stark consequences. \"Helene's winds were responsible for killing 11 people - all from trees falling onto homes in the greater Augusta area,\" a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center told BBC Sport. \"At least 362 homes and buildings were destroyed, while 3,000 others suffered major damage, and 3,500 others experienced minor to moderate damage.\" Augusta officials say almost 17,000 fallen trees have been removed from the city Residents living close to Augusta National had to leave their homes. Thousands were left without electricity and water. Joseph Crosby, his wife Kasey and their three children still cannot live in their storm damaged home, about five miles from the iconic course. He recalls watching a mature Ash tree, which he estimates had grown over 60 feet tall, being \"blown around like a rag doll\". \"I think your brain compartmentalises what you're going through,\" Joseph recalls of the night itself. \"All you think of at that moment is just survival and keeping your kids safe.  \"I just remember thinking if the tree came down on our house or something were to happen, would my kids be OK?\" The Crosby family home is among 1,695 properties damaged in the city of Augusta. City officials estimate the cost of residential losses has reached $282m (Â£220m). \"Folks here are resilient but this won't soon be forgotten. It reminds one how frail and furious nature can be,\" local journalist Joe Kovac told BBC Sport.  Augusta National Golf Club was not as badly affected as the suburbs nearby. But it did not escape.  \"After the storm when you rode around Augusta National, on Washington Road, the pile of trees was above your car for mile after mile,\" said Bonitatibus. Trees came down in their hundreds on the famed course, damaging one of golf's most famous greens on the par-three 16th. Walking the course now is a lighter, less claustrophobic experience.   You can see through wooded areas that previously screened individual holes and made them their own isolated stations. The separation of the ninth and first fairways is less cluttered.  Coming down the 11th hole it is possible to see into the neighbouring Augusta Country Club course. The wooded area to the right of the newly-laid 16th green will have fewer shadows when the world's best golfers begin their challenge for the famous Green Jacket on Thursday.   Speaking in January, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley said: \"As far as the golf course goes, it's in spectacular condition. \"We had minor damage to the course, the playing surfaces themselves, but we were able to get that back in shape. \"I don't think you're going to see any difference in the condition for the Masters this year.\" Kovac, who recently wrote a vivid account of the city's recovery process,, external agreed. \"I was struck by how emerald-green it is, at least the periphery. It is as if the grass never flinched,\" said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter. \"The kerbside lawn around the course perimeter looks manicured to the hilt. Only regular patrons will really notice trees are missing. \"But further into the miles of neighbourhoods ringing the National one cannot help but see the wreckage and its remains.\" Driving around Augusta, it does not take much to notice the roadsides still populated by fallen trees - oaks, ash and giant pines.  Long established homes bear scars of severe roof damage, much of it protected only by the flimsy tarpaulins. Life has been dominated recently by the need to join lengthy queues for construction and repair workers.  \"It's been a journey, just rebuilding. It's been really neat to see the community come together in a town like this,\" said Kasey Crosby. \"We've heard lots of stories of neighbours helping each other. \"Cutting neighbours out of their driveways so they can get their cars out and get to work, or to get to the grocery store.  \"People are pulling together, helping one another with chainsaws and just showing up.\" Augusta is described by its government as a 'centre of medicine, manufacturing, and military'.  However, its job market has long been unstable and the city is ranked among the neediest in the US. In December 2023, local newspaper, the Augusta Chronicle, reported it was ranked the nation's fifth worst city for economic well-being. Child poverty, food insecurity and unemployment rates were highlighted as particular problems. Blue tarpaulin covering the roofs of Augusta houses is a common sight  Augusta National, which stumped up $20m (Â£15.8m) in Masters prize money last year, is well aware of its privilege. In the aftermath of Helene, the club provided $5m of financial support to the relief fund. Bonitatibus, a riverkeeper who looks after the Savannah waterway, says the aid had a \"huge\" impact and reinforced Augusta National's philanthropic role in the community. The money helped provide food, water, laundry, showers and counselling services. Bonitatibus estimates the city is about \"60%\" through its recovery, although fears the environmental impact will last for \"many, many years\". \"We have things we need to shift as a community so when the next storm comes we're more prepared,\" she said. \"In terms of planting trees again, that's a couple of generations. We lost a 100-year-old on our property.\" Masters week, which has been held in Augusta since 1934, has long been one of the biggest economic drivers in the city. Last year, Forbes reported it contributes an estimated $120m (Â£94m) annually., external A hefty percentage of the 200,000 population rent out their homes - and land - for players, patrons and the media to lay their heads. Given the devastation, this Masters week holds extra significance and will provide a much-needed financial injection for the thousands affected. Many have been hanging on, forlorn and frustrated, in the hope of a positive answer from insurance companies deluged by desperate claims. \"The Masters is definitely the time when we put our best foot forward â and we're doing that again,\" said Bonitatibus. \"We're happy it is here â thank goodness, we need the proper cash. This is a huge opportunity for us to get back right.\"",

Thousands of comments flood in, people make reaction videos, your random thoughts are referenced as gospel, and the TikTok content machine starts to whir.  If you’re of a certain demographic with certain interests — namely lifestyle, beauty, fashion, and New York City — you’ve probably already seen this viral 43-second clip that has spiraled into a full-blown Discourse Cycle. Earlier this month, a TikTok user, who had 90 followers at the time, posted a video that cut right to the chase: “All right guys, I’m just going to say it: I hate all of the New York influencers. I think they’re boring as fuck, and I think they’re all carbon copies of one another,” the creator, @martinifeeny, says. The biggest influencers based in New York wear and buy the same things, she goes on to say, and they’re all thin and pretty but boring. In the comments, people called out the specific boutique fitness classes and skincare routines that appear to form the lion’s share of the influencers’ hobbies; some made the point that following a more diverse set of influencers would solve the problem entirely. Some influencers — apparently feeling personally attacked — made (and deleted) videos responding to the original one. You do not need to know the specific influencers enmeshed in the discussion (though Vulture has a good run down), live in New York, or even follow influencers to get the point. Social media is awash in people who look, sound, and act like their peers, often for money. This “drama” is narrowly focused on one type of person, but it is a microcosm of the internet writ large: the most visible content online is just a slightly different version of something else. In November, I wrote a story that might be the galaxy-brain version of the “influencers are boring” discourse — the saga of two young women so similar to one another that there’s a legal battle being waged to try and figure out if one of them broke the law. The two influencers are not based in New York, but if they were, they might be wrapped up in the current TikTok firestorm. In lay terms, their content style is best described as “basic.” They almost exclusively promote products purchased on Amazon, which itself lacks any substance and style so it can appeal to the widest customer base possible. The lawsuit claims that one influencer copied another’s very standard look so closely that she infringed on the plaintiff’s copyright and trade dress. There’s a lot to be said about how and why certain people are elevated to bona fide capital-I Influencer status. Some of it has to do with who you are — your race, class, gender, disability status, and other aspects can push your career along or make it more difficult to ascend. The “New York City” designation is mostly a branding exercise. As other content creators have pointed out, the biggest influencers based in the city do not engage with their surroundings beyond going to restaurants, bars, and shopping. The city is a backdrop for selling their audiences clothing, home decor, makeup, and other consumables. Many of the women in this archetype are clients of the same talent manager who helps them secure sponsored content deals and advertising campaigns with a roster of brands.  As I detailed in my story about the Amazon influencers, the platforms these content creators have hitched their wagons to demand replicability; the algorithms reward palatable and ideologically neutral content that fits into established genres. It is easier to make videos that look like those of your peers than it is to create an entirely new format. As an influencer, you are making content that must be understandable to recommendation systems, and if the number goes up when you make boring videos, then that’s all the signal you need to keep doing the same thing over and over. If it feels like everyone is the same, it’s because they are all milking the same formula that social media platforms tell them is working. It’s like the MrBeast YouTube thumbnail strategy, but for women in their 20s, whose brand revolves around them posting videos from the West Village.  Our digital feeds will continue to get more monotonous, not less Platforms pushing user behavior (and creativity) toward a dull average has become a defining characteristic of the current state of the internet. Before you notice the repetition on TikTok, you’re more likely to see this same thing happen with websites you visit — there’s a reason all recipe sites look the same, why every article you click on suddenly has subheads and author bios. In this example, it’s Google setting the conditions for engagement, and a captive audience of SEO workers who jump through hoops to make sure their sites are visible in search. When your life depends on people seeing and engaging with your article, TikTok video, Instagram Reel, there’s little reason to stray from what catches on, and often what travels the most is painfully, mind-numbingly average. The fact that technology companies promise the next frontier of human creation is AI — which are, by definition, average generators — suggests that our digital feeds will continue to get more monotonous, not less. Is it any surprise then that this crop of New York women building influencer careers and businesses all seem the same? It’s not necessarily that they, as people, are indistinguishable. But they are hired by the same brands to produce the same videos to appeal to the same potential customers, and this cycle repeats until someone new but similarly fitting comes along and shifts the goalposts slightly.  Ultimately, this debate over carbon copy influencers fundamentally misunderstands two things. One is what these influencers are doing when they post. Their job is first and foremost in advertising — how many different ways can you sell a handbag? The second mistake is assuming the facsimiles are an anomaly of life online — that NYC influencers are boring because they’re boring people, that engaging user interest requires content to be interesting, or that there was any other possible outcome given the incentives and basic technological capacities and restrictions at play.  But this proliferation of look-alike, sound-alike, and feel-alike women isn’t a bug. It’s a feature.

        "full_content": "King Charles III has sent his condolences to the people of Myanmar after Friday's deadly earthquake. In a message on social media, King Charles spoke of the shock and sadness he and the Queen felt about the earthquake, which killed more than 1,600 people. He sent their \"deepest possible sympathy\" to those who had lost loved ones, homes or livelihoods.  The King is understood to be staying at his Highgrove estate after spending time in hospital earlier this week due to side effects from his cancer treatment. The 7.7-magnitude quake killed hundreds at the epicentre near Mandalay, Myanmar. Its powerful effects could be felt hundreds of miles away in Thai capital Bangkok, as well as in China and India. There have been reports of widespread devastation in the Saigaing region and in Mandalay, where buildings have been flattened and temple spires toppled. Officials in Myanmar say more than 1,600 have died so far, with another 2,376 injured. The UK Foreign Office said it would send £10 million in humanitarian aid to Myanmar to support the response \"in the hardest hit areas of the earthquake\".  Charles wrote: \"My wife and I were most dreadfully shocked and saddened to learn of the devastating earthquake in Myanmar, with its tragic loss of life and appalling damage to homes, buildings and livelihoods, not to mention the destruction of sacred pagodas, monasteries and other places of worship. \"I know that the people of Myanmar continue to endure so much hardship and tragedy in your lives, and I have long admired your extraordinary resilience and spirit.\" He added: \"At this most difficult and heartbreaking of times, my wife and I send our deepest possible sympathy to all those who have suffered the profound tragedy of losing their loved ones, their homes and their precious livelihoods.\" The King, 76, cancelled a trip to Birmingham on Friday on medical advice, Buckingham Palace said. He had spent a short time in hospital the previous day.  He left Clarence House, his London residence, on Friday morning to travel to his Gloucestershire estate.  His cancer diagnosis was announced in February 2024. The Palace has not said what type of cancer he has, nor what the recent side effects were.",

Sam Altman said the upgraded tool is ‘more popular than we expected’ as users flood the internet with Studio Ghibli-style images. by  Emma Roth OpenAI is pushing back the rollout of ChatGPT’s built-in image generator for free users. In a post on Wednesday, CEO Sam Altman admitted that the image-generation tool is more popular than he expected, adding that “rollout to our free tier is unfortunately going to be delayed for awhile.” OpenAI only just added image generation capabilities to ChatGPT on Tuesday, allowing users to create images directly within the app using the company’s reasoning model, GPT-4o. Since its launch, users have flooded social media feeds with photos transformed into images generated in the style of Studio Ghibli, a trend that even Altman has gotten in on. GPT-4o comes with improvements to text rendering and uses “an autoregressive approach” to image generation, which means it generates an image from left to right and top to bottom instead of all at the same time.

        "full_content": "During Donald Trump’s first term, Steve Bannon explicitly laid out what the administration’s strategy would be to get things done: “flood the zone with shit.” The theory is pretty simple: throw out as much bullshit as possible—knowing that there is only so much attention, outrage, and resistance that people can muster—and take wins while everyone else takes the bait. It’s not hard to see that this approach has been kicked into hyperdrive during the first months of Trump’s second term, facilitated in no small part by Trump-backer and “first buddy” Elon Musk turning Twitter into a cesspool of distraction, disinformation, and disorientation. In what should be an extremely information-rich environment, it’s become near-impossible to separate signal from noise. Luckily, some fine folks are keeping their eyes on the ball so that we don’t all fall victim to the high-stakes shell game. First up, there is the Project 2025 Tracker. Started as a spreadsheet maintained by two Redditors, the project has grown into a larger resource designed to keep tabs on the Trump administration’s progress in implementing the plans laid out in Project 2025—a 900-plus page blueprint for consolidating executive power and reshaping the government to serve a right-wing Christian Nationalist agenda. Project 2025 Tracker has broken out the policy recommendations of the Heritage Foundation’s guiding document, identifying them as goals of the administration and tracking its progress in actually accomplishing those efforts. Those goals are attached to specific agencies and are searchable in the project’s database, or you can track the overall progress of the administration’s efforts. So far, it’s going pretty well for them: Project 2025 Tracker estimates that Trump and his team have already accomplished nearly 40% of the goals established by Project 2025. As for Musk’s attempts to flood the zone, journalist Judd Legum of Popular Information and Musk Watch has launched a new project called DOGE Tracker—an audit for the pseudo-agency that claims to be auditing the federal government but somehow keeps having to revise its own numbers. DOGE Tracker has a simple premise: don’t take Elon Musk at his word. Instead, the project digs into DOGE’s claimed savings, the actual itemized cuts that DOGE has bothered to record, and actual verifiable canceled funding. You’ll be shocked (well, no, you wouldn’t) to hear that these numbers don’t add up. According to DOGE Tracker, the department has claimed to achieve $105 billion in savings as of March 12, 2025, but has only documented $29.9 billion of it—and just $8.6 billion in savings can actually be verified. That means that Musk and his crew have overstated what they have saved the country by about 92%. We’re barely two months into this iteration of the Trump presidency. Things are not going to slow down. The one will continue to be flooded. Use these tools to filter out the bullshit and pay attention to what matters. \nDOGEDonald TrumpElon Muskproject 2025Trump administration  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Tesla's presentation last year for a Cybercab gave sci-fi dystopia vibes that drew concern from Alcon Entertainment.\n         \n          What seems at first like a logical move to modernize the government's archives may in fact be an ill-advised decision.\n         \n          China's response to tariffs could hit Hollywood.\n         \n          Navarro said Musk wasn't a manufacturer of cars, just an \"assembler.\"\n         \n          The billionaire class stands to lose more than the average American from Trump's dumb trade war.\n         \n          Our reality just keeps getting stupider.",

        "full_content": "Myanmar's military has announced a temporary ceasefire to speed up relief and reconstruction efforts following last week's devastating earthquake. In a statement, the ruling junta's State Administration Council said the deal would be in effect from 2 April to 22 April. Earlier this week, rebel groups fighting the military unilaterally declared a ceasefire to support relief efforts - the military had refused to do the same until Wednesday's announcement. At least 2,886 people are now known to have been killed after the magnitude- 7.7 earthquake struck last Friday. Hundreds of people are still missing. The earthquake was also felt hundreds of miles away in neighbouring countries like Thailand, where the death toll currently stands at 21. Myanmar has been gripped by violence amid a civil war between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. On Tuesday night, Myanmar's military opened fire at a Chinese Red Cross convoy carrying earthquake relief supplies. The Ta'ang National Liberation Army, an armed rebel group, said that military troops shot at the convoy of nine vehicles with machine guns in eastern Shan State.  The convoy was en route to Mandalay, the hard-hit city near the epicentre of the earthquake. No injuries have been reported. The junta, which said it was investigating the incident, denied shooting directly at the vehicles. It said troops fired shots into the air after the convoy did not stop, despite it being signalled to do so. China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that its rescue team and supplies were safe, adding that it hoped \"all factions and parties in Myanmar will prioritize earthquake relief efforts\". Myanmar's humanitarian crisis has worsened significantly after last week's earthquake. The actual death toll is believed to be much higher than the official figures provided by the junta. Multiple international aid agencies and foreign governments have dispatched personnel and supplies to quake-hit regions. A military spokesperson on Wednesday said troops saw the aid convoy coming from Naungcho township on Tuesday night, with vehicles sporting Chinese stickers and Myanmar number plates, but had not been given prior notice of the vehicles' movement. \"When we saw the convoy, we stopped it. But they continued. We opened fire from about 200m away, but they didn't stop,\" he said.  \"At about 100m away, we fired three shots in the air, after which the vehicles turned back towards Naungcho.\" China's Blue Sky Rescue Team, which has been providing rescue support in Mandalay, had been given a security cover when they travelled through this route, the spokesperson said. He added that when international agencies want to give aid, they need to inform the Myanmar government. The TNLA, which was escorting the Red Cross convoy, said they had informed the military council about going to Mandalay. After retreating to Naungcho, they would be continuing their journey, the group said in a statement.",

        "full_content": "Myanmar's military junta has continued to bomb parts of the war-torn country following the major earthquake there, which has killed more than 1,600 people. The UN has described the attacks as \"completely outrageous and unacceptable\". Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews told the BBC that it was \"nothing short of incredible\" that the military was continuing to \"drop bombs when you are trying to rescue people\" after the earthquake. He called on the military regime, which seized power in a coup nearly four years ago to stop all military operations. \"Anyone who has influence on the military needs to step up the pressure and make it very clear that this is not acceptable,\" he said. \"I'm calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations,\" he added. BBC Burmese confirmed that seven people had been killed in an air strike in Naungcho in northern Shan state. This strike took place around 15:30 local time, less than three hours after the quake had struck. Pro-democracy rebel groups that are fighting to remove the military from power have reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in the north-western Sagaing region, the epicentre of the quake. There are also reports of airstrikes in regions near the Thai border. The National Unity Government (NUG), which represents the ousted civilian administration, said in a statement that its armed forces would begin a two-week pause in \"offensive military operations, except for defensive actions\" in areas affected by the earthquake, from Sunday. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Sagaing was also felt in neighbouring countries. It was followed by reports of destruction coming from nearby Mandalay - Myanmar's second largest city - as well as the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, which is more than 150 miles (241km) away.  The junta says 1,644 people are known to have died and many more are believed to be trapped under rubble. The quake comes after four years of civil war in Myanmar that followed a military coup in 2021. The coup triggered huge protests, with thousands taking to the streets daily, demanding the restoration of civilian rule. What initially began as a civil disobedience campaign soon evolved into a widespread insurgency involving pro-democracy and ethnic rebel groups - which eventually sparked an all-out civil war. Four years on, violent fighting has continued between the military on the one hand, and ethnic armies and armed resistance groups on the other. The junta, which has suffered continual and humiliating defeats and lost vast swathes of territory, is increasingly relying on air attacks to crush resistance to its rule. Large parts of the Sagaing region, the epicentre of the earthquake, are now under the control of pro-democracy resistance groups. A BBC investigation revealed that nearly four years after seizing power in a coup, the military now controls less than a quarter of the country. The investigation revealed that ethnic armies and a patchwork of resistance groups now control 42% of the country's land mass, while much of the remaining area remains contested. It's in aerial combat that the military regime has the upper hand. Resistance groups lack the capacity to fight back in the air. The military has a history of carrying out indiscriminate aerial bombardments that have destroyed schools, monasteries, churches, and hospitals. In one of the deadliest airstrikes, more than 170 people were killed, including many women and children. The UN body investigating human rights violations in the country has warned that the military junta is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity against its own people. The military's aerial warfare is being sustained by continued support from Russia and China. Despite UN calls for an arms embargo in response to the coup, both China and Russia have sold the junta sophisticated attack jets and provided training on how to use it. Russia and China have also now sent aid and rescue teams into Myanmar. But UK-based Burmese rights activist Julie Khine said: \"It's hard to trust the sympathy now, when they're also the same countries supplying the military junta with deadly weapons used to kill our innocent civilians.\" There is also widespread concern that the military will use aid as a weapon in the civil war. Myanmar's military has a longstanding practice of denying aid to areas where resistance groups are active. The UN's Tom Andrews told the BBC that during past relief efforts, the military  blocked aid and arrested aid workers. \"What we know from past humanitarian disasters, natural disasters, is that the junta does not reveal the truth. It also has a habit of blocking humanitarian aid from getting to where it is most needed,\" he said. \"They weaponise this aid. They send it to those areas that they have control of and they deny it to areas that they do not.  \"So you have areas in which the most acute needs exist and you have literally aid trying to get in, trucks blocking the way, people being arrested and that has been the pattern of their response to natural disasters in the past. \"I'm afraid I'm fully expecting that that will be the case with this disaster.\"",

        "full_content": "About 15 children's backpacks lie torn apart in the rubble - pink, blue and orange bags with books spilling out of them. Spiderman toys and letters of the alphabet are scattered among broken chairs, tables and garden slides at the remains of this preschool destroyed by the huge earthquake that hit Myanmar on Friday. It is in the town of Kyaukse, about 40km (25 miles) south of Mandalay, one of the areas hit hardest by the 7.7 magnitude quake that killed at least 2,000 people. Kywe Nyein, 71, weeps as he explains that his family are preparing to hold the funeral of his five-year-old granddaughter, Thet Hter San. He says her mother was having lunch when the devastating earthquake began. She ran to the school, but the building had collapsed completely. The little girl's body was found about three hours later. \"Fortunately, we got our beloved's body intact, in one piece,\" he says. Locals say there were about 70 children, aged between two and seven, at the school on Friday, learning happily. But now there is little left except a pile of bricks, concrete and iron rods. The school says 12 children and a teacher died, but locals believe the number is at least 40 - that is how many were in the downstairs section that collapsed. Residents and parents are distraught. People say the whole town came to help with the rescue work and several bodies were retrieved on Friday. They describe mothers crying and calling out the names of their children long into the night. Now, three days later, the site is quiet. People look at me with grief etched on their faces. Aid groups are warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, with hospitals damaged and overwhelmed, though the full scale of devastation is still emerging. Before we arrived in Kyaukse, we had been in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. The worst-hit area we saw there was a building that had been residential quarters for civil servants. The whole ground floor had collapsed, leaving the three upper floors still standing on top of it. There were traces of blood in the rubble. The intense stench suggested many people had died there, but there was no sign of rescue work. A group of policemen were loading furniture and household goods on to trucks, and appeared to be trying to salvage what was still useable. The police officer in charge would not give us an interview, though we were allowed to film for a while. We could see people mourning and desolate, but they did not want to speak to the media, fearing reprisals from the military government. We were left with so many questions. How many people were under the rubble? Could any of them still be alive? Why was there no rescue work, even to retrieve the bodies of the dead? Just 10 minutes' drive away, we had visited the capital's largest hospital - known here as the \"1,000-bed hospital\". The roof of the emergency room had collapsed. At the entrance, a sign saying \"Emergency Department\" in English lay on the ground. There were six military medical trucks and several tents outside, where patients evacuated from the hospital were being cared for. The tents were being sprayed with water to give those inside some relief from the intense heat. It looked like there were about 200 injured people there, some with bloodied heads, others with broken limbs. We saw an official angrily reprimanding staff about other colleagues who had not turned up to work during the emergency. I realised the man was the minister for health, Dr Thet Khaing Win, and approached him for an interview but he curtly rejected my request. On the route into the city, people sat clustered under trees on the central reservation of the highway, trying to get some relief from the hot sun. It is the hottest time of year - it must have been close to 40C - but they were afraid to be inside buildings because of the continuing aftershocks. We had set out on our journey to the earthquake zone at 4am on Sunday morning from Yangon, about 600 km (370 miles) south of Mandalay. The road was pitch black, with no street lights. After more than three hours' driving, we saw a team of about 20 rescue workers in orange uniforms, with logos on their vests showing they had come from Hong Kong. We started to find cracks in the roads as we drove north. The route normally has several checkpoints, but we had travelled for 185km (115 miles) before we saw one. A lone police officer told us the road ahead was closed because of a broken bridge, and showed us a diversion. We had hoped to reach Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, by Sunday night. But the diversion, and problems with our car in the heat, made that impossible. A day later, we have finally reached the city. It is in complete darkness, with no street lights on and homes without power or running water. We are anxious about what we will find here when morning comes.",

        "full_content": "As California recovers from devastating wildfires and hurricane season fast approaches, President Donald Trump and the White House DOGE team are slashing the workforce at the federal agency responsible for monitoring extreme weather. Business Insider spoke to more than a dozen current and former employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who said that staff and policy changes were making their day-to-day jobs more challenging. They worried about how the upheaval would affect Americans' safety — especially as hurricane and tornado seasons rapidly approach. Andrew Hazelton, a former NOAA hurricane modeler who was fired in February alongside other probationary employees, was blunt: If forecasts and hurricane warnings go downhill, he told BI, \"we could see loss of life as a result.\" The agency's reach extends across the country and the globe. Besides its work on extreme climate conditions, NOAA provides the data that powers the weather app on your phone, alerts pilots to turbulence, and helps farmers know when to plant to keep American agriculture rolling. \"It really, truly affects every single American every day,\" a former probationary employee said. (Some employees we spoke to asked to remain anonymous.) Before Trump took office in January, NOAA employed around 12,430 people, according to a congressional report. More than 1,000 employees have departed through layoffs or buyouts, said JoAnn Becker, the president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union representing NOAA employees. More than 600 were terminated in February and about 500 took the administration's buyout offer, according to previous reporting. Between the uncertain future for probationary employees, voluntary early retirements and buyouts, and Trump's ongoing government-wide reduction-in-force effort, the agency may shrink further. \"We would like to just go on and do our jobs and save people's lives,\" an employee at the National Weather Service, a department within NOAA, said. Outside of staffing cuts, some employees said stricter rules around travel and expense budgets have made it difficult to do the jobs that are vital to protecting people from natural disasters. Expiration dates for contracts marked as \"urgent\" are also coming up soon, according to internal documents viewed by BI. An \"extensive process was conducted to ensure that mission-critical functions to fulfill NOAA's statutory responsibilities weren't compromised,\" a Trump administration spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson declined to provide additional details about the process. Susan Buchanan, a NOAA spokeswoman, said that the agency remains dedicated to its mission. A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, did not respond to a request for comment from BI. For those who remain, the show must go on, even as resources and staff dwindle. \"We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people,\" a NOAA employee said. \"Eventually one of them is probably going to fall.\" Several people who spoke to BI expressed unease over how the staffing cuts and operational changes at NOAA could affect the aviation industry. Though flying remains the safest mode of transportation, a National Weather Service employee who's worked at the agency for more than a decade said that if the turmoil at the agency continues long term, \"I don't know if I'd trust getting on a plane.\" NOAA assists with running aviation-specific weather models for pilots, helping them track things like turbulence. Its data \"ripples right through the whole system,\" Brad Colman, the former president of the American Meteorological Society, said. \"If systems are degraded, a turbulence forecast may go down in quality, and uncertainty is increased,\" Colman said. \"There's more exposure, more risk.\" A spokesperson for the Airline Dispatchers Federation told BI in an email that NOAA provides dispatchers with \"essential tools,\" including turbulence, wind, and weather forecasts. \"Virtually all\" of the weather data for domestic flights comes from NOAA, and its data is \"fundamental\" to daily operations, the spokesperson said. The organization hasn't yet noticed operational impacts but warned that \"even subtle degradations could affect our operations.\" The Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment. Meteorologists who work for airlines receive foundational data from NOAA to develop their forecasts, the spokesperson added, noting that smaller airlines will likely face more challenges if NOAA's data degrades — potentially creating a disparity in safety across the industry. Or as Tom Di Liberto, a former public affairs official and climate scientist who was fired in February, put it: \"There's a reason why a lot of weather forecast offices are close by or at a major airport.\" Staffers affected by the terminations weren't just at NOAA's headquarters in Maryland; they were stationed in regional offices across the country. One office in Alaska stopped launching daily weather balloons to collect data for forecasts, Larry Hubble, an upper air program manager in the state, said. On March 20, the National Weather Service temporarily suspended weather balloon launches at offices in Nebraska and South Dakota, while seven other sites are scaling back to one launch a day instead of two because of staffing shortages. Other instruments, like radars on commercial aircraft and satellites, also collect data. The NWS employee of more than a decade said that balloons are one of the most accurate methods of weather measurement, and if they're scaled back, \"they're going to start seeing the degradation of the models and the forecast is going to lose its accuracy.\" \"If you degrade our capabilities, our warnings get weaker and people and property get compromised,\" a NOAA employee told BI. \"Damages are going to increase, people are not going to get out of harm's way, and they're going to die.\" The Government and Accountability Office said in a March report that staffing shortages and aircraft maintenance problems in recent years had already hampered hurricane hunters' ability to perform their jobs — well before DOGE ever came knocking on doors. The changes at NOAA will likely ripple across the private sector, affecting a range of industries, some employees told BI. The reinsurance industry, for example, uses NOAA data to help confirm damages from natural disasters and dole out funds. Construction workers rely on NOAA data to figure out where to build new projects. The economic implications are vast — NOAA's products impact more than one-third of the country's GDP, according to the agency's website. \"If you take out NOAA, the private sector cannot do what NOAA does,\" Di Liberto said. The agency operates thousands of weather balloons, hundreds of buoys, 10 airplanes, and 18 satellites and makes that information accessible to the entire public — not just those who can pay for it. The spokesperson from the Airline Dispatchers Federation said that private weather companies provide helpful supplemental services, but they ultimately rely on NOAA's raw data. \"There is simply no replacement for NOAA's comprehensive data collection infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said.

The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Myanmar Friday has climbed to more than 2,000, and officials say they expect that number to rise even further. The search for those still buried under the rubble, meanwhile, continues. One woman was pulled out of the wreckage of a 12-story apartment building in Mandalay alive. Beneath the historic temples of Mandalay, the destructive power of Myanmar's worst earthquake in a century is clear to see. The country's second-largest city bore the full force of the disaster. At the Sky Villa condominium, rescue workers were digging through the rubble with their hands. Ninety people were feared to be trapped. The building housed apartments and a wedding venue, but its 12 stories now resemble six after it pancaked in seconds. The first shipments of international aid arrived at the airport in the former capital, Yangon. They came from neighboring China and  India and included search and rescue and medical teams, as well as blankets, and other provisions.  \n                Indian and Myanmar rescuers carry a dead

Relief efforts are focused on Myanmar, where the estimated death toll rose to 1,644 by Sunday afternoon. The number of dead from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake is expected to increase, while the number of injured was at 3,408 and the missing figure rose was 139 on Sunday. The earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17. While food, medicine and other vital supplies have reached Myanmar, a report issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said rescue efforts have been hampered by a severe shortage of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicine and tents to house health workers. \"We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,\" said Mohammed Riyas, the IRC's Myanmar director. Here is a look at some of the contributions in supplies, personnel and monetary support and the nations and groups providing assistance: On Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay. China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits, generators, earthquake detectors and drones while pledging around $13.8 million in emergency aid. Hong Kong on Saturday dispatched 51 search-and-rescue personnel including firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs. The group brought 9 tons (18,000 pounds) of equipment including life detectors and an automatic satellite tracking antenna system, according to a statement on the Hong Kong government's website. The Hong Kong government also will set aside HK$30 million ($3.9 million) from its Disaster Relief Fund to help Myanmar victims. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, Myanmar's second-largest city, and Russia's Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team that includes specialists in infectious diseases, resuscitation, traumatology and psychology, as well as search and rescue teams with canine units and devices that can search in rubble with depths as much as 4.5 meters (14.7 feet). Two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday brought in a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who traveled north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment center, the country's Foreign Ministry said. India previously said it planned to send five aircrafts and four ships with relief supplies including rescue team and medical teams. Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country would send 50 personnel to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas. South Korea said it will provide $2 million in humanitarian aid through international organizations. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a post on X that his government would support relief efforts \"via the International Red Cross Movement.\" The European Commission said Friday it would release 2.5 million euros ($2.7 million) in initial emergency assistance to assist with earthquake relief, bringing the European Union's total humanitarian aid for Myanmar to more than €35 million ($37.8 million) this year. Ireland announced Saturday the government would provide an aid package of €6 million ($6.49 million) with €3 million ($3.2 million) to support the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Myanmar Red Cross Society, €1.5 million ($1.6 million) each to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund and U.N. Refugee Agency Joint Response Plan. President Donald Trump said Friday the U.S. would help with the response, but some experts were concerned about the promised effort given his administration's deep cuts in foreign assistance. The U.N. humanitarian affairs office said it has mobilized with other groups and $5 million has been allocated from a Central Emergency Response Fund for \"life-saving assistance.\" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies released 2 million Swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to support the organization's work in Myanmar, Jagan Chapagain, the organization's secretary general and CEO, said in a social media post Sunday. Cara Bragg, the Yangon-based manager of Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar, said relief efforts have largely consisted of local volunteers trying to find loved ones. Despite the influx of countries sending search and rescue teams, \"hospitals are really struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, there's a shortage of medical supplies, and people are struggling to find food and clean water,\" Bragg said.",

The surprise announcement by military leaders who also head the unelected government came late Wednesday on state television MRTV, which said the halt in fighting would run until April 22 to show compassion for people affected by Friday's quake. The announcement followed unilateral temporary ceasefires announced by armed resistance groups opposed to military rule, and the military warned that those groups must refrain from attacking the state and regrouping, or else face \"necessary\" measures. The resistance forces have also reserved the right to fight in self-defense. Earlier Wednesday, rescuers pulled two men alive from the ruins of a hotel in Myanmar's capital, a third from a guesthouse in another city, and another in the country's second city, Mandalay, five days after the quake. But most teams were finding only bodies. The quake hit midday Friday, toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. The death toll rose to 3,003 on Wednesday, with more than 4,500 people injured, MRTV reported. Local reports suggest much higher figures. The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis due to Myanmar's civil war. More than 3 million people had been displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million were in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations. In the capital, Naypyitaw, a team of Turkish and local rescue workers used an endoscopic camera to locate Naing Lin Tun on a lower floor of the damaged hotel where he worked. They pulled him gingerly through a hole jackhammered through a floor and loaded him on to a gurney nearly 108 hours after he was first trapped. Shirtless and covered in dust, he appeared weak but conscious in a video released by the local fire department, as he was fitted with an IV drip and taken away. State-run MRTV reported later in the day that another man was saved from the same building, more than 121 hours after the quake struck. Both were age 26. \n                Buddhist novice monks sit under temporary shelter near a road, in the aftermath of Friday's earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    AP/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Another man, a 47-year-old primary school principal, was rescued by a team of Malaysian and local crews from a collapsed guesthouse in the Sagaing township, near the epicenter of the earthquake close to Myanmar's second-largest city, Mandalay, where a fourth rescue was reported Wednesday night. The earthquake also rocked neighboring Thailand, causing the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok. One body was removed from the rubble early Wednesday, raising the death total in Bangkok to 22 with 35 injured, primarily at the construction site. Myanmar's military seized power in 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has turned into significant armed resistance. Ceasefires had been announced earlier this week by the People's Defense Force, which is the armed wing of the shadow opposition National Unity Government, and the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a trio of ethnic minority guerrilla armies. \n                Local residents ride motorbikes near damaged buildings in the aftermath of Friday's earthquake, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    AP/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n That had put pressure on the military government to follow suit, said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies. It's too early to say whether a pause in fighting could lead to something longer lasting, he said. \"It would require very deft and active diplomacy to transform a humanitarian pause into something more lasting. And that's not guaranteed,\" Morgans said. The military government was particularly vulnerable to bad publicity this week because its leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was expected for a high-profile visit to a regional conference in the Thai capital Thursday. It will be his first to a country other than his government's main supporters and backers — China, Russia and Russia ally Belarus — since he attended another regional meeting in Indonesia in 2021. Min Aung Hlaing and other senior leaders are shunned and sanctioned by many Western countries for their 2021 takeover and human rights abuses as they try to crush the resistance to their rule. Before Wednesday's ceasefire announcement, an opposition militia belonging to the Brotherhood Alliance reported that the military fired on a relief convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross vehicles late Tuesday in the northern part of Shan state. The Ta'ang National Liberation Army said that the Chinese Red Cross was bringing supplies to Mandalay and had reported its route to the military. But Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the military government, said that the convoy hadn't notified authorities of its route ahead of time, MRTV reported. While not mentioning the Red Cross, he said that security forces had fired into the air to deter a convoy that refused to stop. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun didn't comment on the attack. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was looking into the matter. Countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organizations with the monumental task ahead, while also sending in specialist search and rescue teams and setting up field hospitals. India and China, both neighbors of Myanmar that compete for influence there, have been especially quick and generous with assistance. Multiple other countries have sent teams, including Turkey, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. \n                In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Chinese rescuers move a survivor out from a collapsed building in the aftermath of an earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Cai Yang/Xinhua via AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The U.S. government has pledged $2 million in emergency aid and sent a three-person team to assess how best to respond given drastic cuts to U.S. foreign assistance. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that continuing aftershocks are complicating humanitarian response efforts. In Mandalay City, many people are completely cut off from electricity and running water. \"People affected continue to need urgent healthcare and medical supplies, safe drinking water, food and other critical items,\" Dujarric said. \"Tents and temporary shelter are needed, as well as latrines and other hygiene items, to prevent disease outbreaks.\" Most of the details so far have come from Mandalay, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake, and Naypyitaw, about 270 kilometers (165 miles) north of Mandalay. Many areas are without power, telephone or cellphone connections, and difficult to reach by road, but more reports are beginning to trickle in. In Singu township, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Mandalay, 27 gold miners were killed in a cave-in, the independent Democratic Voice of Burma reported. In the area of Inle Lake, a popular tourist destination northeast of the capital, many people died when homes built on wooden stilts in the water collapsed in the earthquake, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported.",

        "full_content": "The National Weather Service is reducing the number of weather balloon launchesâand thus, the amount of data collected from American skiesâfollowing sweeping cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by the Trump White House. Hundreds of federal workers at NOAAâabout 10% of the workforceâwere fired on the last day of February, as the Trump administration continued its culling of federal funding across the sciences. âWeâre going to lose data because of this staffing,â said Michael Morgan, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and former NOAA administrator, in a press conference Monday. âAnd that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast.” According to a National Weather Service wire published late last week, weather balloon observations are now suspended out of Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, due to a lack of staffing. Inside Climate News reported that launches were also suspended in Kotzebue, Alaska. Typically, the NWS launches weather balloons twice each day from 100 sites across the country, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Basin. The radiosondes attached to those weather balloons collect information on a suite of factors that contribute to weather, including temperatures, dew points, humidity, barometric pressures, and wind speed and direction. A second NWS Public Information Statement said that weather balloon launches would be cut down to a single launch per day out of Aberdeen, South Dakota, Grand Junction, Colorado, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gaylord, Michigan, North Platte, Nebraska, and Riverton, Wyoming. âDoes it mean every single forecast is going to be poor?” Morgan added. “No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.â Similar views were espoused by NOAA meteorologist and hurricane hunter Andrew Hazelton, who spoke to Gizmodo last week as his employment status wended its way through the federal court system. Hazeltonâand many other federal employeesâhave been left in employment limbo afterÂ being laid off, but now reinstated, albeit not permitted to work. “Whenever thereâs a hurricane, better forecasts allow people to get outâor vice versa, if theyâre not going to be impacted, they donât have to close up their school or business,” Hazelton told Gizmodo. “Better forecasts save lives and money. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself.” Last month’s cost-cutting measures also reduced the workforce at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Park Service, among other agencies. It will take time to see the impacts of the layoffs across the board, and the same goes for the staffing shortages at NWS locations. The NWS Press Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Exactly how this diminished data will affect weather forecasts won’t be clear immediately, but what is clear is that the cuts will mean we have less information about what’s going on in our skies. \nBalloonDOGElayoffsNOAAWeather  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          What seems at first like a logical move to modernize the government's archives may in fact be an ill-advised decision.\n         \n          Navarro said Musk wasn't a manufacturer of cars, just an \"assembler.\"\n         \n          The Social Security Administration has been a target of Elon Musk over unproven allegations of rampant fraud.\n         \n          An already weakened agency workforce will be severely culled in the coming weeks, per DOGE's orders.\n         \n          The CDC is set to cut a third of its contracts spending within the next two weeksâthe latest bit of dismantling orchestrated by the Trump administration.\n         \n          \"Elon Musk should become Donald Trump's special envoy for midterm elections,\" said one Democratic Party leader.",

Of those tropical cyclones, nine are forecast to become hurricanes, with four of those expected to reach \"major\" hurricane strength. \n\nThat would mean a few more tropical storms and hurricanes than in an average year, yet slightly quieter conditions than those observed across the Atlantic basin last year. This time last year, researchers from CSU were warning of an \"extremely active\" hurricane season with nearly two dozen named tropical storms. The next month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released an aggressive forecast, warning the United States could face one of its worst hurricane seasons in two decades. \n\nThe forecast out Thursday underscores how warming oceans and cyclical patterns in storm activity have primed the Atlantic basin for what is now a decades-long string of frequent, above-normal -- but not necessarily hyperactive -- seasons, said Philip Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State and the forecast's lead author.",

On the 5th floor of her university dormitory building, she wasn't used to the rumbling sound coming from the lower floors. Then, the earthquake began. \"I realized there was a problem, and if I didn't get down soon, I wouldn't be able to escape anymore,\" she said. \"I thought, 'Am I going to survive?' \" Chit had experienced quakes in Myanmar before, but never on this scale. The temblor with a magnitude of 7.7, struck at around 12:50 p.m. local time (1:50 a.m. ET) on Friday. It has devastated large areas within Myanmar, and was felt in Thailand and China as well. State-run media reports that the death toll has now risen to over 1,600, with over 3,400 injured inside Myanmar. It is thought the death toll will continue to rise. \n                The map above shows the epicenter of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar.\n                \n                    \n                    Phil Holm/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The quake's epicenter, roughly 10 miles from the town of Sagaing in central Myanmar, is close to Myanmar's second most populated city, Mandalay. The damage there and in the surrounding regions has been extensive. Rushing down to the ground floor, Chit emerged onto the streets of Mandalay, now covered in dust. Videos shared on social media show wreckage on the streets, with multiple buildings collapsed. Another shows the Sagaing bridge, an important connecting point between Mandalay and the rest of Myanmar, destroyed. \"People are asking for help to rescue their family members from the fallen-down buildings. On the street, the people who could escape from dangerous conditions are sleeping on the empty ground,\" Chit said. John McGown, program director for Plan International, an NGO active in Myanmar, said, \"We have staff members who have family in Mandalay that weren't able to sleep inside their homes last night because of fear of tremors.\" Internet and phone lines were also cut in Mandalay, Sagaing, and in southern Shan state, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reported Saturday. Although some areas are now periodically reconnected, the disconnect initially left residents like Chit cut off from their families, unable to find out whether they had survived or not. In the face of the destruction, Myanmar's ruling military junta have made a rare request for humanitarian aid. On Friday, Russia said 120 rescue workers had been sent to Myanmar to assist in the search for victims caught in the rubble. China, meanwhile, has pledged to provide Myanmar with 100 million yuan ($13.8 million) in humanitarian aid and also sent teams to assist in relief efforts. President Trump on Friday said the U.S. would also help with the response. But, although countries around the world have pledged to send support, the quake has also made coordination of rescue efforts more difficult. Plan International's McGown told NPR that communication difficulties have made it impossible for teams from the organization to coordinate in real time as they enter the hardest hit areas. Damage to infrastructure has also slowed teams' efforts to reach certain towns. The quake has compounded existing issues within Myanmar. Since 2021, the country has been run by a military junta and been engaged in an ongoing civil war that has devastated large areas. \"The earthquake has taken what were already marginal issues and has made them worse and made it more difficult to access information and even to access certain areas,\" McGown said. The initial quake has also been followed by numerous aftershocks of up to 6.4 magnitude. In Bangkok, which was also hit by the quake, rescue efforts have focused on a 30-story building that collapsed following the earthquake. With drones, sniffer dogs and heavy machinery, rescue operators have been working around the clock to free dozens of people thought to be trapped inside. Families of those trapped inside have congregated outside of the slumped building. Many have been waiting there for more than 24 hours, holding out hope that their loved ones will soon emerge.

        "full_content": "More than 12,000 acres have burned in North and South Carolina as wildfires continue to rage through the states’ western region. The situation has prompted emergency declarations in both states, and mandatory evacuations have been ordered in several counties.  The wildfires come as many continue to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene just six months ago. The category 4 storm killed more than 100 people in North Carolina and over 50 in South Carolina. This week’s blazes were in part fueled by downed timber from the hurricane, coupled with wind and dry conditions.  Advertisement Advertisement Here’s how you can help victims and first responders in the Carolinas.  Associa Cares was created to help families and communities in the wake of disasters. The organization aims to provide direct financial relief to those impacted and has already earmarked $100,000 to support individuals and families affected by the recent wildfires across North and South Carolina.  The American Red Cross has been providing emergency assistance and disaster relief for over a century. The organization has opened an evacuation shelter in South Carolina and is supporting several shelters in North Carolina. While it says it no longer is in need of supplies to help wildfire survivors, the organization is still accepting monetary donations. World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit food relief organization founded by celebrity chef José Andrés, is often on the ground providing meals for victims and first responders of disasters around the world. The organization is currently in North Carolina providing meals for first responders.  South Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an offshoot of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, is an association of groups that help provide services to communities affected by disaster. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division “ways to help” webpage directs individuals to make monetary donations to SCVOAD, and contact them for volunteer opportunities.  The city of Walhalla's fire department has posted a list of needed items for the 400 first responders combating fires in South Carolina. The department asks that the requested items, which range from eye drops to safety goggles, are delivered by Friday, March 28.",

Experts say the episode highlights the social media site's enduring influence, even as it helps amplify falsehoods. How did it happen? Around 8:30 a.m. ET, the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett was asked during a live Fox News interview whether President Trump would consider a 90-day pause to the sweeping tariffs he imposed on many countries last week. Hassett responded: \"I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.\" On X, that morphed into a bogus headline that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China. It appears the X account \"Hammer Capital\" was the first to share this false report, around 10:11 a.m. ET on Monday. The account has just over 1,100 followers, and it has a blue verification badge, a paid feature that helps enhance the reach of a user's posts. From there, the erroneous headline took on a life of its own. Dozens of other accounts with blue verification badges reshared it. Not long after, news organizations including Reuters and CNBC reported the unsubstantiated claim.  Around 10:12 a.m. ET, cheers broke out across the New York Stock Exchange trading floor, according to CNN, as the market rallied on the false premise that the White House was weighing a tariffs pause. About a minute later, it was posted by the X account \"Walter Bloomberg,\" which has more than 850,000 followers. Although the account is not affiliated with Bloomberg News, it often shares the news organization's headlines. The account's boosting of the false headline prompted chatter among CNBC analysts on live television about a possible 90-day reprieve from Trump's tariffs. Reuters, citing CNBC, then published a headline carrying the inaccurate tariff pause report. The White House denied the report. The Walter Bloomberg account deleted the post on X. Reuters and CNBC soon backtracked, but not before stock markets gyrated to the tune of $2.4 trillion between the time of 10:08 a.m. and 10:18 a.m., according to Dow Jones Market Data. In statements to NPR, Reuters said it has withdrawn the incorrect report, blaming a headline published on CNBC. When asked for comment, CNBC said it \"aired unconfirmed information in a banner,\" which it \"quickly\" corrected. The network would not comment on the source of its information. The wild market swing reflected how Wall Street investors are increasingly gripped with fear that Trump's tariffs could lead to global economic instability.  Neither X nor Musk responded to NPR's requests for comment. Reporters went back and forth with the relatively obscure finance-focused X account \"Hammer Capital\" that appears to have started the rumor. Whoever is behind the account claimed to be merely sharing information from \"trading desks,\" but would not elaborate. Attempts to reach the person behind the Hammer Capital account were unsuccessful. To scholars of disinformation like Kate Starbird at the University of Washington, the market mayhem spurred by posts on X underscores the dangers of social media with both few guardrails and policies in place that incentivize virality over truthfulness. \"Our social media systems — and X in particular — are designed in such a way that rumors spread extremely quickly, while corrections lag far behind. Verification is challenging (and slow), in part because it's often hard to determine the original source of a particular claim,\" Starbird told NPR.  \"Changes to account verification on X, which were put into place after Musk purchased Twitter, make it even more difficult now for social media users and other information consumers to figure out which accounts and what information we should trust.\"",

        "full_content": "Lumiose City turns into a fight club at night. Lumiose City turns into a fight club at night. by  Charles Pulliam-Moore Real time day / night cycles have been featured in a lot of Pokémon titles since the Gold and Silver era, but Pokémon Legends: Z-A is going to take the classic mechanic in a wild new direction. During today’s March Direct presentation, Nintendo dropped a new Pokémon Legends: Z-A trailer showcasing a few of the game’s returning monsters and revealing more about how battling will work in this new take on Lumiose City.  Unlike the franchise’s previous games where you had to catch wild creatures out in, you know, the wild, Legends: Z-A will involve hunting down pokémon found throughout Lumiose itself as the city undergoes a massive redevelopment plan to make it more hospitable to both humans and pokémon.  The trailer makes it seem as if, in the daytime, Legends: Z-A’s gameplay will be more focused on catching pokémon, and NPC trainers you encounter won’t necessarily want to fight on sight. At night, however, the city’s “aura” changes and battle-hungry trainers flood its streets to participate in the Z-A Royale, which sounds like a competition to figure out who’s the best. Trainers participating in the Z-A Royale will be found in designated battle zones where making eye contact is all it takes to get things rolling. But, similar to the way you could get the jump on wild pokémon in Legends: Arceus, players will also be able to get the jump on Z-A Royale battlers by sneaking up behind them and sending out a pokémon to initiate a fight. Surprising NPCs will give you an advantage over them, but the trailer also makes it look like timing and dodging within the battle will be key to mastering Z-A. It’s also clear that participating in the Z-A Royale and going from Rank Z to Rank A will be necessary to complete the game’s story. But given how differently the game seems like it will play depending on the time of day, it feels like Nintendo wants this to be a Pokémon game you play how you want.

        "full_content": "Relief efforts continue in Southeast Asia after a devastating 7.7 earthquake shook Myanmar and its neighbors on Friday, March 28. Per an update shared by the Myanmar authorities on Saturday, the death toll has risen above 1,600. In addition, authorities report over 3,000 people are injured, with over 100 others missing. Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, is among the hardest-hit areas, with widespread destruction. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a total of 18 people have been reported killed by the earthquake so far. 11 of those were at the site of the collapse of a high-rise building under construction. Dozens of people are said to be unaccounted for. Advertisement Advertisement On Sunday, March 30, a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck near Mandalay, prompting alarm before rescue efforts continued. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand Myanmar’s ruling military junta declared a state of emergency in several regions affected by the earthquake on Friday, and called for humanitarian aid in a rare show of international appeal. Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said in a statement that the earthquake “could not come at a worse time” for Myanmar, as it still reels from the 2021 military coup and subsequent displacement of masses in a civil war. “All parties to the armed conflict should be prioritizing the needs of civilians whose lives have been upended in this disaster and ensuring that they have unfettered access to aid,” Freeman said. “Human rights must be at the centre of all relief efforts, and there must be no discrimination in aid provision.” UNICEF, originally the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, has also addressed Myanmar’s precarious situation. A statement on the UNICEF USA website has called for “all parties to uphold the rights of children and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.” As the affected areas continue to recover—a process that has only just begun—countries around the globe have come out to send humanitarian aid. Here are the ways that you can help victims of the Myanmar earthquake. The United Nations is calling for donations in addition to an initial allocation of $5 million from the U.N. Emergency Fund by Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher. Donations will go directly to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund, and will “provide them with urgently needed food, water, shelter and other basic support at this critical time.” The “Red Cross Red Crescent is working to deliver emergency relief and to get help to those impacted by the earthquake as quickly as possible.” Teams from the Myanmar Red Cross Society are also working to connect hospitals and clinics with emergency blood donations. UNICEF runs disaster relief operations focused on children’s needs and has asked for donations specifically for children impacted and displaced by the earthquake. “UNICEF is on the ground in Myanmar, working with partners to meet children's needs. The earthquake is the latest blow to a country already struggling with escalating conflict and climate shocks,” the agency’s website reads. Save the Children is an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) that works specifically to protect children at risk. They have launched a “Children’s Emergency Fund” for youths in Myanmar in need of shelter and other basic needs in the aftermath of the disaster. Project HOPE is working to “address both urgent and long-term needs, including primary and mental health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene,” for those affected by the earthquake. The nonprofit organization has previously responded to other natural disasters by deploying humanitarian aid to places such as Morocco, Syria, Turkey, and Haiti.",

        "full_content": "A previously overlooked factor may have contributed to the debilitating strength of Hurricane Idalia, which cost the United States billions of dollars when it struck in August 2023. According to a team of researchers that studied the climatic conditions around the storm, the typical cocktail of weather conditions that feed a hurricane doesn’t add up in Idalia’s case. The team’s research analyzing the storm’s evolution was published last month in Environmental Research Letters. The team found that the usual suspectsâwarm sea surface temperatures, ocean heat beneath the surface, and low vertical wind shear all played a role in Idalia’s intensification. But the team found that a freshwater plumeâincluding river discharge into the Gulfâcreated a density gradient between the surface water and deeper, cooler water, allowing Idalia to continue to draw strength from the warmth of the Gulf’s surface. âWind wants to mix the water, bringing cold water up to the surface and warm water down to the depths,â said marine scientistÂ Chuanmin Hu, one of the studyâs authors, in a NASA Earth Observatory release. âBut the density gradient between surface fresh water and deeper salty water makes this difficult.â Plumes from rivers have historically contributed to the intensification of hurricanes; according to the release, more than two-thirds of storms between 1960 and 2000 that hit Category 5 strength at some point in their cycles passed over the historical region of freshwater plumes. âIf you have a persistent river plume in the right location at the right time,â Hu said, âyou may have a perfect storm.â Hurricane Idalia carved through Florida’s Big Bend before charting a northeasterly course across the American Southeast. The storm quickly swelled from a Category 1 to Category 4 storm, subsiding only slightly into a Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall on August 30, 2023, with maximum sustained winds of nearly 125 miles (205 kilometers) per hour. The hurricane raised concerns about gas contamination, cut off power for hundreds of thousands of people, and even dropped a tree on the Tallahassee home of Governor Ron DeSantis. The storm shaped up to be the costliest of 2023, tallying a whopping $3.6 billion in damages. The storm departed over the Atlantic on August 31 after cutting across Georgia and the South Carolina coast. The analysis of contextual factors in Idalia’s formation could help researchers better understand the conditions that foster extreme storms in the future. Consider Hurricane Milton, which shattered records in October 2024 when it intensified from a Category 1 storm to a Category 5 storm in just 7 hours, after feeding on very warm waters in the western Gulf. Category 5 storms are the highest intensity on theÂ Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; to be a Category 5 storm, a system must achieve wind speeds greater than 157 miles per hour (253 kilometers per hour). When Milton touched down in central Florida as a Category 3 storm, it spawned at least three dozen tornadoes across the Sunshine State. As ocean temperatures continue to break records for warmth, we should expect more extreme and rapidly evolving hurricanes. Hopefully, similar research to the Idalia study will lead to improved forecast models,Â so that authorities can be prepared for these storms’ landfall.

        "full_content": "In his forty-plus years in the textile industry, Larry Severini has seen hundreds of factories close, as companies moved women’s wear and home furnishings and then other textile manufacturing overseas.  But Severeni was able to maintain two factories that make the blue backgrounds and white stars for American flags—until January 31, 2025. On that day, he closed his factory in Gaffney, S.C., for good, getting rid of millions of dollars of machinery and laying off dozens of workers, some of whom had been laboring there for decades.  Advertisement Advertisement “People are buying flags from China at an artificially low price that we can’t compete with,” says Severini, who still has one factory open, in Kingstree, S.C., which makes star fields for the flag and other textiles.  It may sound strange to hear of a manufacturing company closing right now. In the second Trump Administration, the President has promised—and levied—tariffs on countries including China, Canada, and Mexico in an effort to boost American manufacturing. Trump also levied tariffs on Chinese goods in his first term that the Biden Administration maintained. “This administration is leaving 40 years of failed industrial policy behind and bringing American manufacturing BACK!” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X  recently.  But despite the bravado, many of those working in the textile industry say conditions are tougher than ever, with 27 textile factories shuttering in the last 20 months, according to Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, a lobbying group.  They blame a once-obscure trade provision, called de minimis, which has been thrust into the spotlight in recent months. President Trump ended de minimis in a February executive order before reversing himself days later as chaos ensued. The White House said de minimis would resume when “adequate systems are in place” to deal with the shipments.  Created by Congress in 1938, de minimis allows people to import packages worth less than $800 without paying tariffs on those packages or going through formal customs paperwork. It was created as a nod to consumer fairness: travelers were able to bring back a certain amount of goods from overseas without paying customs on those goods, supporters reasoned, so people who couldn’t travel should have the same privilege. In 2016, Congress raised the threshold from $200 to $800. Retailers like Severini say that the de minimis provision allows Chinese factories to send cheap goods, such as American flags, to the U.S. without the same tariffs that they would have to pay to send the same product to China. Severini says he suspects that sellers on e-commerce websites like Amazon order large quantities of American flags, avoid paying tariffs on them through de minimis, and then sell them online, sometimes labeling them as made in the U.S.A.  “It’s a major hurdle that our industry really needs some breathing room from,” he says.  There are a huge number of goods that come into the country under de minimis. In 2023 alone, the U.S. saw $54.5 billion worth of de minimis imports, or about 1 billion total shipments, up from $0.05 billion, or 110 million shipments, in 2012. About 30% of de minimis shipments are goods that Americans buy on sites like Shein and Temu.  “It’s essentially a free trade agreement for China and the rest of the world,” says Glas, of NCTO.  Ironically, there’s evidence that Trump’s first-term trade war was what helped expand de minimis shipping. After the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, Chinese exporters looked for new ways to ship things to the U.S. and avoid tariffs, and landed on de minimis.  Whether ending de minimis could really jumpstart industries like textiles is up for debate. Most of the goods that people buy through de minimis are inexpensive, and so a 25% or even 40% tariff wouldn’t raise the cost of it very much. There are American flags listed on Temu, for example, for less than $3.  Avoiding de minimis saves importers money in other ways, says Amit Khandelwal, a Yale economics professor who recently co-authored a paper on what would happen if de minimis went away. Importers who don’t have the benefit of de minimis have to go through customs paperwork and logistics challenges that can increase the price of a package by as much as $20 apiece, which significantly raises costs.  Still, because of the cost of labor and materials overseas, Chinese and other manufacturers may still be able to make cheaper goods than those made in the U.S., Khandelwal says. “Domestic producers claim they will benefit from the end of de minimis,” he says. “I’m not so sure.”  In his research, Khandelwal also found that consumers who live in lower-income zip codes and those with higher shares of minorities disproportionately benefit from de minimis. They’re more likely to shop at sites like Temu and Shein and to buy goods that have come into the country under the provision. “If you remove de minimis, it’s going to look like a regressive tax,” says Khandelwal, meaning that it hurts lower-income people the most. Severini argues that these people are getting goods at an artificially low price. After all, countries like Mexico and China have much lower de minimis limits, he says. He hopes that Congress will get rid of the loophole entirely, which looks increasingly likely to some observers.  Doing so, Severini says, would help get his Kingstree factory back up to three shifts a day, which it was running before the pandemic—and before de minimis shipments started taking off. Workers in the factory make $16 an hour plus performance incentives, Severini says. One of his former workers laid off from the Gaffney did find a job, he adds—at an e-commerce warehouse helping sort goods that come in from overseas.",

        "full_content": "A major earthquake in Myanmar on Friday has caused more than 3,000 deaths and led to the collapse of numerous structures. Even though the south-east Asian nation is a high risk region for earthquakes, neighbouring Thailand and China - which were also affected by the quake - are not. The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it. Here we will explain what caused this earthquake, and how it was able to have such a powerful effect so far away. The earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other. It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes. Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically \"active\" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate. The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate. Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to \"slither\" sideways.  There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long. Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a \"strike-slip\" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other. This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault. As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake. Earthquakes can happen at up to 700km (435 miles) below the surface. This one was just 10km from the surface, making it very shallow. This increases the amount of shaking at the surface. The earthquake was also very large - measuring 7.7 on the moment scale. It produced more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey.  The size of the quake was because of the type of fault, said Dr Bell. \"The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,\" she explained.  \"There have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.\" This straight fault also means a lot of the energy can be carried down its length - which extends for 1,200km south towards Thailand. When it comes to why the earth shook so much, scientists believe it is because the quake was a rare \"super shear\" - meaning energy from the rupture in the earth's crust built up because it was moving faster than seismic waves can travel through the earth. Seismologist Prof Frederik Tilmann, from the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Germany, explained in analysis shared online that the rupture travelled at a speed of about 5km per second - making it \"the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet\".  Because the fracture \"unzipped\" towards the south, it also directed this piled up energy towards the Thai capital, Bangkok, and this is why the earthquake had such an impact so far away.  How earthquakes are felt at the surface is also determined by the type of soil.  In soft soil - which is what Bangkok is built on - seismic waves (the vibrations of the earth) slow down and build up, getting bigger in size.  So, Bangkok's geology would have made the ground shaking more intense. While dramatic footage has emerged of high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying during the quake - knocking water from rooftop pools - the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office Bangkok's Chatuchak district appears to be the only skyscraper to collapse. Prior to 2009, Bangkok did not have a comprehensive safety standard for constructing buildings to withstand earthquakes, according to Dr Christian Málaga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London. This means that older buildings would have been particularly vulnerable. This is not unusual, as earthquake-resistant buildings can be more expensive to construct and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience earthquakes. Dr Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, noted that older buildings can and have been strengthened, such as in California, western Canada and New Zealand. Prof Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, said that while there were regulations in 43 provinces on earthquake-proofing buildings, less than 10% of buildings are estimated to be quake-resistant. Yet the building that collapsed was new - in fact, it was still under construction when the earthquake hit - and the updated building standards would have applied. Dr Pimarnmas said Bangkok's soft soil may have also played a part in its collapse, as it can amplify ground motions three or four times over. He added: \"However, there are other assumptions such as material (concrete and reinforcements) quality and some irregularity in [the] structural system. These remain to be investigated in detail.\" Having studied the video, Dr Málaga-Chuquitaype said it appears a \"flat slab\" construction process was being favoured - which is no longer recommended in earthquake-prone areas. \"A 'flat slab' system is a way of constructing buildings where floors are made to rest directly on columns, without using beams,\" he explained.  \"Imagine a table supported only by legs, with no extra horizontal supports underneath. \"While this design has cost and architectural advantages, is performs poorly during earthquakes, often failing in a brittle and sudden (almost explosive) manner.\" Mandalay in Myanmar was much closer to where the ground slipped and would have experienced significantly more severe shaking than Bangkok. Although Myanmar regularly experiences earthquakes, Dr Ian Watkinson, a lecturer in earth sciences at Royal Holloway University, thought it was unlikely that many buildings were constructed to be earthquake-proof. \"General poverty, major political upheaval, alongside other disasters - e.g. the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 - has distracted the country from concentrating on the unpredictable risks from earthquakes,\" he said. \"This means that, in many cases, building design codes are not enforced, and construction happens in areas that could be prone to enhanced seismic risk, for example flood plains and steep slopes.\" Parts of Mandalay and its buildings also lie along the floodplain of the Ayerwaddy River. This makes them very vulnerable to a process called liquefaction. This happens when the soil has a high water content, and the shaking causes the sediment to lose its strength and behave like a liquid. This increases the risk of landslides and building collapses, as the ground can no longer hold them up. Dr So warned that there was \"always a chance\" of further damage to buildings near a fault line due to aftershocks - tremors that follow an earthquake, which can be caused by the sudden transfer of energy into nearby rock. \"Most of the time aftershocks are smaller than the main shock, and tend to decrease in size and frequency over time,\" she said.",

        "full_content": "Business owners on River Road are expressing concerns as a multi-phase construction project by the Louisville Water Company threatens to further complicate an already economically-challenging year. The project, which will replace a decades-old water line with two new ones, will impact several establishments along the heavily-used thoroughfare for the next two years. Restaurants and other businesses along the road say they're already seeing fewer patrons, making things harder when some are still struggling to recover from damage left behind by severe flooding in mid-February. KingFish manager Chris Sparrow said construction is already impacting the establishment with only a handful of tables and frequent calls from area residents asking if the business is open. With clean-up still ongoing from the flooding, he worries the project will prevent him from getting back on even footing. \"It's definitely taking a toll on us already,\" Sparrow said. \"The river was not very kind to us. We're going to have to spend money to get that mess cleaned up from the flood, and that money's not going to be generated back to us from the business that we're not going to be getting because of the construction.\" Construction will impact River Road, frequently used by commuters to get to and from downtown, and is expected to back up traffic on Interstate 71 and U.S. 42, said John Varanese, owner of River House Restaurant and Raw Bar. The best detour to access open businesses near the construction is Mellwood Avenue to Mockingbird Valley Road, which some could consider too far to travel. \"We've already had a challenging year. In the summertime, we could look at a thousand customers a day,\" he said. \"Now is the time to visit because it's not just the business, it's the livelihood of 120 employees just at this one location, let alone the other businesses on River Road that are going to be affected by this.\" Related: River Road closes Monday as Louisville Water Company starts project construction Sparrow says heading into the peak season for KingFish, he's hopeful for the best but worried that fewer guests will frequent the establishment. After Memorial Day, the restaurant typically hosts a motorcycle bike night on a weekly basis, often drawing in a large turnout with half the parking lot designated for bikes, but Sparrow says some won't want to drive through \"a bunch of construction.\" Louisville Water Company spokesperson Kathleen Speicher said the organization began working with area businesses prior to construction and is \"maintaining a consistent flow of communication with them\" throughout the process. \"We have posted numerous signs letting drivers know how to access the restaurants and businesses located in the area. We hope to minimize the traffic impact as much as possible, and we encourage customers to continue visiting those restaurants and businesses,\" Speicher said. \"Louisville Water realizes two years of rolling road closures is daunting, and we are working with our contractor to expedite that timeline if we can do so safely and efficiently.\" Reach Marina Johnson at Marina.Johnson@courier-journal.com.",

LONDON -- An earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude has rocked Southeast Asia on Friday, according to the United States Geological Survey. USGS is reporting the epicenter of the quake was in Mandalay, Myanmar, but at least three people were killed and 68 others were injured when a building that was under construction collapsed in Bangkok as the earthquake struck the region on Friday, according to Thailand’s National Institute of Emergency Medicine (NIEM), which said there was an unknown number of people still trapped in the rubble. The extent of the damage in Mandalay -- the second largest city in Myanmar -- is largely unknown this morning due to it being under very tight state control. However, it is thought that the damage could be extensive since this earthquake is stronger than many other historic quakes -- including the Northridge earthquake that affected the Los Angeles area of California on Jan. 17, 1994, which is remembered as one of the most destructive and deadly in California history. Bangkok is approximately 600 miles away from Mandalay and suffered notable damage as well as collapsed buildings. NIEM said there were approximately 320 construction workers on site when the building in Bangkok collapsed at 70 people are currently missing, according to a statement published on social media. Approximately 20 workers are still trapped in the elevator shaft with the number of deaths expected to climb, NIEM continued. Alarms reportedly went off in buildings across the Thai capital city when the earthquake hit around 1:30 p.m., according to the Associated Press. \"We were under the main Sukhumvit railway station and we thought a train had crashed on the initial tremor,\" a British citizen who is in the Thai capital on a business trip and wished to remain anonymous told ABC News. \"But then as it continued, people started to run outside and the hotels were evacuated to the streets.\" The Royal Thai Police said they are helping to evacuate people from buildings across the city into safe areas, according to a statement published on social media. A video obtained by ABC News from a WeWork office in Bangkok shows water pouring from a rooftop swimming pool as people ran across the office towards the exits. Two of Bangkok’s main public transportation systems, the BTS -- an elevated train line -- and the MRT, which is mostly underground, have stopped service as authorities respond to the earthquake aftermath, Thai police said. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s ruling junta has declared a state of emergency in six regions -- Sagaing, Mandalay, Magway, northeastern Shan State, Nay Pyi Taw and Bago – after the earthquake struck the country, followed by a series of aftershocks. Myanmar is mired in yearslong civil war, and Mandalay is one of the major cities that the junta still controls. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

[…] According to prosecutors, the group as a whole has targeted US state and federal agencies, foreign ministries of countries across Asia, Chinese dissidents, US-based media outlets that have criticized the Chinese government, and most recently the US Treasury, which was breached between September and December of last year. An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg News found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stole more than 3,000 files in that intrusion. The indictments highlight how, in some cases, the hackers operated with a surprising degree of autonomy, even choosing targets on their own before selling stolen information to Chinese government clients. The indictment against Yin Kecheng, who was previously sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January for his involvement in the Treasury breach, quotes from his communications with a colleague in which he notes his personal preference for hacking American targets and how he’s seeking to ‘break into a big target,’ which he hoped would allow him to make enough money to buy a car. \nTags: China, cyberattack, cyberespionage, espionage, hacking, law enforcement  \nPosted on March 11, 2025 at 1:14 PM\t\t\t•\n\t\t\t17 Comments",

Will this enlightened approach prevail? By Erica Gies edited by Mark Fischetti Floodwater inundates Pájaro, Calif., on March 12, 2023, after the Pájaro River, swollen with rain from an atmospheric river storm, breached local levels. Shae Hammond/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images Controlling nature by bulldozing dirt and pouring concrete has long been the guiding vision of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. For 250 years that ethos inspired both awe and disgust. “In my science training, the Army Corps destroyed everything. They’re the enemy,” says geomorphologist Julie Beagle, who spent much of her early career working to repair ecosystems damaged by “gray” infrastructure such as dams and levees built by the Corps. “My first boss had a sign on her desk that said, ‘Kill the Corps.’” To such critics, damaging nature was the Corps’s core competence. So plenty of people were skeptical in 2010 when the Corps rolled out an Engineering with Nature (EWN) initiative, saying it now aspired to work with nature rather than dominate it—a dramatic change in culture and practice. Engineers and scientists are moving constrictive levees farther from riverbanks and reconnecting rivers with floodplains. They are reusing sediment dredged from shipping channels to strengthen disintegrating tidal marshes. They are partially acquiescing to rivers’ chosen paths while retaining navigation channels. The initiative is relatively small; there are seven EWN programs sprinkled across the Corps’s 43 districts (five of which are international). But the changes convinced Beagle four years ago to leave her job at the San Francisco Estuary Institute and become chief of environmental planning for the Corps’s San Francisco district. She is now one of four “practice leads” who demonstrate and teach EWN across the Corps’s 37,000 employees. One example of her pioneering work is a big project in central California’s Pájaro River basin designed to protect communities from flooding while recharging groundwater to aid farmers and restoring habitat for threatened fish.

Beagle’s career move was risky, given the Corps’s inertia. Its long insistence that it could and should reshape nature for economic benefit has dominated U.S. civil works culture and has been exported globally through Corps projects in more than 130 countries, a practice some call “hydrocolonialism.” Beagle says many people from her adviser’s generation “really rolled over” when she and several other mid-career scientists she knew went to the Corps. But she saw the move as an opportunity to be “a cultural changemaker” in an agency that has remade vast landscapes and waterways. With a $7.2-billion budget for civil works in fiscal year 2025, the agency’s employees oversee 24,000 miles of levees; 926 harbors that they keep dredged for shipping; 749 dams; 350 miles of beaches and dunes; numerous navigation channels and locks; and seawalls and bulkheads along hundreds of miles of coast. How the Corps thinks and what it does shape our world. Levees are built to control nature, but nature often wins, as it did during the Pájaro River flood. DRONE BASE/Reuters/Redux The consequences of its decisions can be deadly. The most horrific failure in recent memory occurred during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 1,400 people in New Orleans and the Gulf region died when levees and floodwalls gave way; 80 percent of New Orleans lay underwater, some areas for 43 days. The Gulf’s famous marshes help to protect human communities from storm surges, but more than a century of levees and dams on the Mississippi River had deprived the marshes of 70 percent of the sediment they need to stand up to a relentless sea. More than 2,000 square miles have eroded away since the 1930s. Shipping canals have sliced and diced freshwater marshes, providing pathways for salt water to infiltrate and kill vegetation and for storm surges to rear up and overtake near-shore communities. Katrina bowled straight up a wide navigation channel called the Mississippi River–Gulf Outlet that the Corps had cut through protective marshes. The Corps’s subsequent shift toward nature-based solutions—working with or mimicking natural systems—is part of an increasingly mainstream global movement. The 160,000-member American Society of Civil Engineers issued a policy statement last summer supporting the practice. People are increasingly recognizing the need for nature-based solutions as climate change is making floods and droughts more severe, and changes in land use—urban sprawl, industrial agriculture and forestry, levees and dams—have dramatically altered the water cycle and eroded healthy ecosystems that for centuries acted as buffers to destruction. Nature-based solutions mean restoring the health of degraded ecosystems so they can provide clean water, absorb floods, store carbon, grow food and support life. Eileen Shader, senior director of floodplain restoration at American Rivers, a nonprofit that advocates for healthy waterways, says that in some cases, “you’re solving the problem by unbuilding.” Still, the Corps’s concept of nature-based solutions tilts more toward engineering and concrete. As Jeff King, national lead of the EWN program, puts it, projects fall somewhere on “a continuum of green-gray.” “You could call the 20th century the century of reinforced concrete. My hope is the 21st century is the century of nature.” —Todd Bridges, University of Georgia The approach could rapidly become more widespread thanks to a Corps rule that went into effect in January 2025 that requires the agency to consider nature-based options on par with gray infrastructure options whenever feasible. The rule also expands the traditional cost-benefit analysis to factor in environmental and social gains of projects, even if it’s impossible to assign a dollar figure. It is “the most significant policy-change update for the Corps in a generation, without a doubt,” says biologist Todd Bridges, who in 2010 created the EWN program out of the Corps’s research division, where he worked for 30 years. Within weeks after President Donald Trump took office this year, his new administration began purging federal government websites of language that seemed progressive, freezing funds for scientific research, and dismantling departments that support human rights, science and the environment. It’s reasonable to ask whether EWN—a progressive shift in a conservative agency—would be a target. The Project 2025 manifesto guiding many administration actions mentions the Corps only once, in passing, but that doesn’t mean the agency will go untouched. At the end of January, in an unusual act, Trump ordered the Corps to release water from two federal reservoirs in California, with a stated goal of letting it flow about 200 miles south to help fire-ravaged Los Angeles. The Corps released 2.2 billion gallons, but the water did not come close to reaching the city. Local water managers scrambled to prevent flooding of nearby towns, while farmers were dismayed to see water they will need in the summer flushed away. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the engineering wing of the U.S. Army. Despite its military basis, its workforce today is 98 percent civilian. Its civil works division is tasked with navigation, reduction of flood and storm damage, and environmental restoration. Local groups lobby Congress for work in their areas, and Congress authorizes projects and partial funding. Congressional authorizations have historically proscribed a single objective, such as flood-risk reduction, a narrow focus at odds with the systems-oriented thinking required for nature-based solutions. The Corps’s urge to try to control nature was solidified in the mid-19th century, when dueling congressional reports outlined how to reduce Mississippi River flooding and ensure navigation. One advocated for a hybrid engineering-nature approach—using not only levees but also outlets to release high river flows, as well as wetlands to absorb rain. It lost out to another vision authored by a Corps engineer who argued for a levees-only approach. The belief that strong walls can best protect communities has dominated the engineering psyche ever since. But the unintended consequences can be extreme. Florida’s Kissimmee River was an early, expensive lesson. In response to prolonged flooding in 1947, the Corps wanted to rush away high river water instead of letting the river overflow onto its floodplains and wetlands. To create a straighter channel with faster water flow, it spent nine years, from 1962 to 1971, cutting out the river’s natural meanders that slow water, shortening the waterway from 103 miles to just 56. The work dried out thousands of acres of wetlands and floodplains, harmed wildlife and increased the flow of pollution into Lake Okeechobee. Damage was immediate and so extensive that Congress authorized the Corps to put back the curves. “A hallmark of 20th-century engineering is that people simplified the natural in order to get what we want,” says Bridges, now a professor of practice in resilient and sustainable systems at the University of Georgia’s College of Engineering. Then he corrects himself: “What we think we want.” Ripley Cleghorn; Sources: National Inventory of Dams; National Levee Database; USACE's Dredging Information System (data) Simplifying the natural order can even worsen the problem engineers are trying to solve. Today 3,500 miles of levees line the Mississippi River. Each levee constricts space for water, raising the surface level higher, speeding up its flow, and worsening flooding for communities that lack a levee or are near one that breaks. Yet the Corps evaluates each new levee on its own immediate merits, not in conjunction with those on the rest of the river. As geomorphologist Nicholas Pinter of the University of California, Davis, has written, even the Corps has acknowledged that the result is “‘death by a thousand blows,’ through the incremental loss of floodplain land to development.” Another unintended consequence is that levees encourage people to move into harm’s way. The Great Flood of 1993 left areas around the Missouri and upper Mississippi Rivers above flood stage for up to 195 days. The Corps worked with a St. Louis levee district to build a 500-year levee—an awkward term meaning the levee would limit the risk of flood in any given year to 0.2 percent (statistically, there is a one-in-500 chance of a flood happening any year). The levee made people feel safe enough to build, in the first decade alone, 28,000 new homes and more than 13 square miles of commercial and industrial development and roadways on land that had been underwater. But it’s a false sense of security, revealed by a dark industry joke that there are two kinds of levees: ones that have failed and ones that will fail. “People think, ‘Why do I flood?’” says Jo-Ellen Darcy, board chair of American Rivers. “Well, you’re living in a floodplain. They’re not named that for no reason.” Indeed, floodplains are a classic nature-based solution. Their job, Darcy says, is “to absorb floods, and they can’t do that if people are living there with concrete structures and malls.” Katrina was a turning point in the Corps’s approach, says Jane Smith, who was a senior research scientist there for 42 years and is now a professor of coastal hydrodynamics at the University of Florida. When Smith and her colleagues ran models after the storm, she says, “we started to see how incredibly important the wetlands were in terms of protection from hurricane storm surge and waves.” Before that, “we didn’t really think of the natural features that provide protection as being part of our projects,” she adds. But Bridges recalls that many Corps employees outside the research division weren’t ready to hear it. He says an engineer told him, “We don’t need any of that tree-hugger science.” Before joining American Rivers, Darcy led the Corps’s civil works as an assistant secretary of the U.S. Army from 2009 to 2017. During her tenure she emphasized an important tweak in language used by the Corps. “It wasn’t ‘flood control,’” she explains. “Nobody can control a flood.” She used “flood-risk reduction,” which acknowledges that reality—and sends a message within the Corps and to the public about the limits of what’s possible. Shader, at American Rivers, works with the Corps nationally and says the agency’s current openness to what she considers effective nature-based solutions varies geographically. “San Francisco is absolutely the lead,” she says. “They have a dedicated staff that is working to create interdisciplinary teams and integrate these concepts into every project.” That’s partly thanks to Beagle, who showed people across the Corps how to take a big standard project and insert nature-based solutions. In March 2023 an atmospheric river storm struck central California, bursting three levees on the Pájaro River and flooding the eponymous town, which is populated by farmworkers and surrounded by fields of berries and greens. The disaster wasn’t a surprise; the four- to 12-foot-high levees lining the river and its two tributaries, Corralitos Creek and Salsipuedes Creek, dated to 1949 and promised just eight-year flood protection—which equates to a 12.5 percent chance of flooding in any year. In 1966 Congress authorized the Corps to build taller, wider levees, but partly because the economics of protecting the low-income community didn’t seem to work out, the project never moved forward. The Corps later realized that adequate protection required giving the waterways more room. It wanted to move some of the long earthen levees that run for 13 miles along both sides of the waterways farther back from the banks. These “setback levees” would create extra space between the levees to hold more water during high flows, reducing overflow flooding. Julie Beagle is leading an innovative Army Corps project that shows how to work with nature. Erica Gies That solution required local people to give up some of their land, and residents resisted for decades. But as the toll of repeated floods mounted, they finally gave in, says Mark Strudley, executive director of the Pájaro Regional Flood Management Agency, a local partner to the Corps. Strudley says farmers in the area realized they were having a hard time cultivating that soggy land, anyway. In October 2024 the Corps broke ground on the multiyear project, known internally as “100 for 100.” It bought up to 100 feet of landowners’ properties along the waterways, offering in return 100-year flood protection: a 1 percent chance of flooding in any year. But Beagle saw that this standard project could be tweaked to simultaneously solve another local problem: a declining groundwater table caused by farmers’ overpumping. When a wild river runs high, water overflows the banks, spreads across the floodplain and slows. It has time to sink underground to supply aquifers, deposit soil nutrients and fine dirt that continually reshape the river, and create habitat that supports fish. But in the decades that the river and its tributaries had been cut off from their floodplains, water squeezing through the levee-narrowed river channel had run faster. Speed gave it power to cut down into the earth, leaving the creeks about 10 to 25 feet lower than the surrounding farmland. If the Corps just set the levees back, Beagle knew, the river would reach the riverbanks only when it ran really, really high. Most of the time water would still be stuck down in the channel, speeding away. It wouldn’t have a chance to replenish groundwater, redistribute soil or help fish. Beagle and Strudley convinced the Corps to turn the plan into an EWN project by pointing out that the change would in fact save money. To build the new, wider levees, the Corps would have had to truck in dirt, which is expensive. Instead it will excavate much of the dirt from the former farmland that will now be inside the setback levees. It will also dig in a way to re-create some of the river’s natural functions, fashioning side channels and earthen steps from the new levees down to the creek. When the river runs high, the channels and steps will slow water, giving it time to sink underground inside the setback levees. This action will refill dwindling groundwater reservoirs and increase flood protection by ensuring some water gets absorbed by the ground and moving the rest of it downstream over a longer period. The design will also allow sediment swishing around within the wider riverbed to create an accessible floodplain again. The river will reshape what the engineers build, and that’s okay, Strudley says. “‘Correcting’ is fighting physics,” he says, “which in general doesn’t end well and wastes a lot of money.” The higher water table will allow farmers to pump water more easily and will feed the creek in the dry season. Slow water inside the levees will allow algae and plankton to grow, feeding fish such as the South-Central California Coast steelhead, a threatened species, and providing refuges where they can rest during their mating migration upstream. The more natural waterway will attract other wildlife, perhaps creating recreation spots for residents and even attracting ecotourists. Although multiple benefits are beyond the singularly focused congressional authorizations, local and state partners want them. Strudley worked with California’s Department of Water Resources, which ponied up the local funding because it is motivated to reverse dropping water tables. “Recognition of those benefits is why the state invested,” Strudley says. “Multibenefit is how you get things done these days. The Army Corps is catching up to that.” Reconfiguring levees along the Pájaro River and its tributaries to slow down rushing storm water will protect people nearby, resupply underground aquifers and restore fish habitat. Erica Gies Scientists from universities in the area are studying those benefits, measuring how 100 for 100 will affect groundwater recharge, sediment movement and fish populations. Quantifying the benefits is fundamental, says King, the national head of EWN, “because engineers have to feel comfortable understanding how these things are going to perform.” Many of these concepts are commonplace in restoration circles, Beagle says, but not so familiar to engineers. “Reading the landscape and understanding how nature works is a different set of skills,” she says. The Corps has a manual for how to build a levee, but it does not have one for floodplain reconnection. It will soon, though. Beagle has co-written national guidelines for floodplain reconnection in the same format as Corps instructions for building a levee, with “equations, loadings, shear stresses, things like that,” she says. Part of Beagle’s role is to educate Corps employees from other districts as they do rotations in the San Francisco district. “It’s really, really satisfying to watch these ideas take off,” she says. She still encounters resistance, however. Some colleagues complain that nature-based solutions are a headache and more expensive because they think these approaches mean adding bells and whistles to an existing project. Yet engineering with nature is often less expensive, Beagle says: “A healthier system maintains itself to a larger degree.” Each of the Corps’s six other EWN proving grounds has its own Pájaros—projects that showcase new approaches. Monica Chasten, head of EWN in the Philadelphia district, is shoring up disintegrating marshes near the southern tip of New Jersey in a 24-square-mile area known as the Seven Mile Island Innovation Lab. Her specialty, coastal engineering, is fundamentally different from civil engineering. “It’s not like designing a bridge,” she says. “Not everything is exact. It’s almost like an art.” Hurricane Sandy was a revelation in the region because marshes and dunes did an especially good job of protecting people. Softer than seawalls, they absorb wave energy rather than bouncing it onto neighboring stretches of coast. But sea-level rise and sediment scarcity threaten to destroy half of the region’s marshes by 2100. The scarcity is partly the result of a long-standing Corps practice. When it dredged fine sediment to maintain coastal shipping channels, it dumped the material into inland basins to simplify compliance with regulations aimed at protecting coastal areas from possible pollutants in the sediment. But in 2023 chief of engineers Lt. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon (now retired) realized the Corps was throwing away valuable material and set a goal that by 2030 it would reuse 70 percent of everything it dredged. Chasten says her district is on track to go beyond that. Some of the fine-grained sediment the Corps dredges from the New Jersey Intracoastal Waterway floats in from the marshes to begin with, so Chasten’s team is pumping clean sediment back into the needy marshes. The impact will be transformative, predicts Lenore Tedesco, executive director of the Wetlands Institute, a New Jersey organization that works on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and is a partner to the Corps. “We’ve built 30 to 50 years of resilience into that marsh,” she says. Engineering with nature can save money because a functional ecosystem is likely to require less maintenance than fully engineered infrastructure. Erica Gies A thousand miles away the Corps’s St. Louis district is following nature’s lead to unravel a problem that the agency helped to create there: floodplain occupation. Edward Brauer, a hydraulic engineer and an EWN project lead, has been relinquishing part of a floodplain to the Mississippi River in Dogtooth Bend, a 17,000-acre chunk of Illinois inside a U-shaped turn of the river that borders Missouri. In the 19th century the area was a rich, shifting blend of wetlands, floodplain lakes, bottomland hardwood forest, cypress and tupelo slough, and cane thickets. “The river did what rivers do and meandered across the landscape,” Brauer says. Levees the Corps installed to create farmland were essentially seeking to stop time. But “it’s a constant battle with the river,” EWN founder Bridges says. And the river is on a roll. The area has flooded increasingly often—in 1993, 2011, 2016, 2017 and 2019—repeatedly washing out roads, ruining crops, and flooding homes in Olive Branch and Miller City. During major breaches, one third of the Mississippi’s flow gushes overland, taking a shortcut across the U. In 2019 Dogtooth Bend was inundated for nearly nine months. Letting the river make the cut might be the most nature-based solution. But the Corps also has a mandate to maintain shipping channels. Brauer is trying to negotiate a truce. Residents tired of repeated flooding have accepted buyouts. On those newly available lands, Brauer’s district is restoring natural floodplains and bottomland forests—habitat for at-risk species that also accommodates the river, reducing the frequency and force of its thrusts across the bend. The vegetation slows water and catches sediment that might otherwise move downstream, reinforcing the existing channel instead. Projects such as Pájaro, Seven Mile and Dogtooth Bend may become more common thanks to key points in the new rule: requirements for equal consideration of nature-based solutions, as well as a broader cost-benefit analysis. The rule, called for in congressional legislation dating back to 2007, was drafted in 2013, but passage was stymied for years by congresspeople who didn’t want the Corps to stop weighting economics over all other things. That dynamic shifted in 2021 when R. D. James, appointed by Trump as the assistant secretary for civil works, became concerned that low-income communities suffering from the massive 2019 Mississippi River floods were being bypassed by the standard cost-benefit analysis. So he wrote a memo outlining the inclusion of social and environmental factors. Still, the new rule does not correct a fatal flaw in standard cost-benefit analyses. A gray project’s destruction of natural systems’ services—absorbing floods, cleaning pollution, providing water in the dry season, generating food, storing carbon dioxide—is not counted against its benefits. Nor does the Corps deduct for a project’s likelihood of increasing flood risk in neighboring communities that are not protected. American Rivers provided input for the rule, and Shader says she’s glad it finally passed. But she’s concerned that it doesn’t provide criteria for choosing between nature-based solutions and gray projects, such as accurately tallying the potential losses. “So it really depends on that individual district and the nonfederal sponsors’ interests,” she says. Trump is likely to choose a new assistant secretary for civil works in his current presidential term. Michael L. Connor, who held that position until October 2024, said then that he’s hopeful the rule will not be overturned. “I don’t think this is a politically controversial rule,” he says. “We were directed to carry this out by the Water Resources Development Act in 2020 that was enacted during President Trump’s term and by a split Congress,” he said. “[It’s] an initiative that has broad support across the spectrum.” Although the new administration was disrupting government in its early days, Darcy says examples of local partners gaining multiple benefits may be politically powerful enough to convince the president and Congress to leave the new rule alone. Perhaps it is dawning on people throughout Congress and the Corps that “the control of nature”—the title of writer John McPhee’s 1989 book about the Corps—is futile. McPhee wrote then that “the Corps has been conceded the almighty role of God.” Subsequent decades have been a reckoning with the almighty power of nature. Regardless of the rule’s fate, the Corps is part of an ongoing, global shift toward nature-based solutions as people recognize the design savvy of harnessing that power. “The 20th century, you could call it the century of reinforced concrete,” Bridges says. “My hope is the 21st century is the century of nature.”",

        "full_content": "Dry conditions, wind and trees downed by Hurricane Helene fueled wildfires in North Carolina and South Carolina, where evacuation orders were in effect Tuesday. Many people in the area are still getting over the hurricane that hit in September, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Bo Dossett. “A lot of the damage and the blowdown, the downed trees from Hurricane Helene are contributing to the difficulties that our firefighters are facing trying to contain this fire and so that has just been kind of one ongoing crisis from September all through into the spring for a lot of these residents,” Dossett said. “This is one more thing that they’re having to deal with on top of what they experienced back in the fall.” Advertisement Advertisement The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for parts of the South Carolina Upstate, western North Carolina and northeast Georgia through Tuesday night, as conditions were expected to be favorable for the rapid spread of wildfire with lingering dry air and winds picking up to 10 to 20 mph (16 to 32 kph) and gusting 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph). Mandatory evacuations were in effect for 146 properties in rural Polk County on Tuesday, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte, North Carolina, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon. Three fires there have burned at least 9.6 square miles (25 square kilometers) in that county and in neighboring Henderson County as of Tuesday, and the two larger fires are uncontained, according to the forest service. Officials released maps Tuesday that show evacuation zones in the two counties. The Black Cove Fire is one of the larger blazes. Officials said a downed power line sparked that fire, but the causes of the other two fires are under investigation. Henderson County has issued voluntary evacuation orders and opened an emergency shelter. Volunteer fire departments were on standby, Henderson County spokesperson Mike Morgan told WLOS-TV. “Especially near some of the homes where if the fire did jump, we can be there to help protect those homes,” Morgan said. “We’re here to monitor the situation very closely.” Two fires were burning in the mountains of South Carolina. The fires in Table Rock State Park and nearby Persimmon Ridge have burned a combined 2.3 square miles (5.9 square kilometers), the South Carolina Forestry Commission said. Officials said both fires were ignited by human activity and neither were contained as of Monday night. No injuries were reported, and no structures were imminently threatened as of Monday night, but voluntary evacuations were issued for about 100 homes over the weekend. On Tuesday morning, the forestry commission updated an earlier announcement to say no evacuations were planned near the Persimmon Ridge Fire, but residents were urged to be prepared to leave their homes if an evacuation is suggested in the future. “The weather over the next few days remains concerning, as relative humidities are expected to remain very low, and the forecasted wind speeds will still be conducive to spreading the fire,” the forestry commission said. Dry weather and millions of trees knocked down by Hurricane Helene last year are creating a long and active fire season in the Carolinas, according to North Carolina State University forestry and environmental resources professor Robert Scheller. Scheller predicted this busy fire season if the region saw dry weather after the hurricane. “Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,” Scheller said. “Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.” Despite recent rain, most of the Carolinas are abnormally dry or experiencing a moderate drought, according to federal monitors.",

LONDON -- The death toll from last week's 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar rose to 3,085 people as of Thursday morning, according to an update released by the country's military government. Another 4,715 people have been injured and 341 others remain missing, the junta said. The epicenter of Friday's magnitude earthquake was near the northern city of Mandalay -- Myanmar's second-largest city. But severe damage has been reported across the country, with thousands of buildings razed, roads destroyed and bridges collapsed. The earthquake also rocked Thailand, where at least 22 people have been confirmed killed and 35 others injured in the capital Bangkok, according to the city's Metropolitan Administration. Most of the casualties there were related to the collapse of a high-rise building that was under construction when the powerful quake struck the region. Search and rescue teams have been working around the clock to find the 72 people who were reported as missing from the incident, Bangkok officials said, with hopes that some may still be alive beneath the heavy, thick layers of debris seven days later. City officials expressed concern that it could rain Thursday, which might hinder ongoing search and rescue efforts. \"We hope that a miracle will happen,\" the administration said in a situation update posted to Facebook. \"For those trapped beneath the debris, if they are still alive, the heat may not be a big issue because there are vents and it is not as hot as above,\" it said. \"The main problem is dehydration.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

For months, Trump has said he's considering getting rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the country's disaster response arm. \"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government,\" Trump said while visiting the Los Angeles fires in January. \"FEMA is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation.\" But emergency management experts say Trump's order technically wouldn't do much to shift responsibility. Currently, local and state governments are already in charge of disasters. The question is whether the Trump administration will begin withdrawing the federal resources and funding that states rely on. When a major hurricane, flood or wildfire hits, FEMA starts working on a disaster only when requested by the state government. The agency organizes thousands of federal workers who help in disaster response and process claims for millions of dollars in aid. Even then, states and local governments still remain in charge. Have information you want to share about ongoing changes at FEMA or elsewhere in the federal government? Reach out to this reporter through encrypted communications on Signal at sommer.55 Without FEMA, states would need to find thousands of additional personnel to inspect damage, distribute disaster aid and plan the rebuilding of public infrastructure. Without federal funding, states would face billions of dollars in recovery costs. After Hurricane Irma in 2017, Florida relied on more than $5.5 billion dollars from the federal government. FEMA also helps states prepare for disasters, which can reduce the damage they cause and the number of lives that are lost. One study from the National Institute of Building Sciences, a non-profit research group, found that federal investment of $27 billion since 1995 to prepare infrastructure for flooding will ultimately save $160 billion. Many state emergency management offices also rely on federal grants to pay their employees. While many states advocate for simplifying FEMA's process for distributing disaster aid, they say FEMA is still a vital partner. As the climate gets hotter, hurricanes, floods and wildfires are getting more intense. FEMA is now responding to three to four times more disasters now than it did in the 1980s. \"It seems counterintuitive to discuss, in a time when we have more and more severe events, when states need more and more help, that we would provide less and less federal resources to support those states,\" says Tim Manning, a former deputy administrator at FEMA under the Obama administration. As soon as Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina in 2024, emergency managers knew they had a monumental task ahead. The storm left a broad swath of destruction in its wake. Heavy rainfall, exceeding 30 inches in some spots, washed out roads and flooded homes and buildings across many towns, some becoming almost impossible to reach. When disasters are larger than both local and state governments are able to handle, they can call in federal help by requesting a federal disaster declaration. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper made that request the day the storm hit, setting the stage for federal resources to come in, like FEMA. Still, FEMA doesn't take over the disaster responses. \"The locals are in charge of their county and their situation and the state of North Carolina advises FEMA on what we need,\" says Justin Graney, chief of external affairs for North Carolina Emergency Management. FEMA is also responsible for marshalling resources from the entire federal government, including from the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \"FEMA doesn't have any helicopters,\" Manning says. \"It doesn't have any aircraft, doesn't have any ships. FEMA's role is to coordinate all those resources from the federal government in support of the states. They are just the organizers.\" As North Carolina residents began taking in the damage from the storm, the immediate needs were for shelter, hot food and medical help, as well as search and rescue for missing people. \"Pretty much everything we had to throw at the storm, we threw at the storm,\" Graney says. \"And then 39 other states sent us resources and teams. So it was a massive response to what turned out to be a massive, catastrophic storm.\" That response included 8,500 federal workers for both Hurricanes Helene and Milton, a storm that hit Florida two weeks later. FEMA brought in its own staff from all over the country, but had to call in personnel from other federal agencies to fill the need. \n                During major disasters, FEMA sends thousands of staff, as well as organizing personnel from throughout the federal government, to help with disaster aid and search and rescue.\n                \n                    \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n One of FEMA's primary roles is getting aid to disaster victims, what's known as \"individual assistance.\" That includes funds for finding temporary housing and funding repairs on homes, when it's not covered by the owner's insurance policy. Some assistance is designed to reach disaster victims within days, allowing them to replace food, pay for temporary hotel stays and replace vital items like medications and clothing. To process those claims, FEMA's call centers for Hurricane Helene got more than half a million calls per week, a volume so high that many went unanswered. Without FEMA, states would need to find and train a similar staffing effort, able to process disaster aid in a very short time. Many states share resources, sending teams to other states in times of need. But as disasters get more intense and frequent with climate change, states have fewer resources to share. \"Those resources become taxed,\" says Claire Connolly Knox, a professor of emergency and crisis management at the University of Central Florida. \"That's where having a federal entity come in and be able to assist and backfill those resources, whether that's people, goods, services, is important.\" FEMA also gives funding to local governments and tribes to rebuild public infrastructure after disasters, including schools, roads, bridges and parks, known as \"public assistance.\" Ahead of disasters, FEMA offers grants so communities can make their infrastructure less likely to be destroyed. Trump has ordered the creation of a new council to do a \"full-scale review\" of FEMA, including recommendations for how to reform the agency. Their report is due within six months of their first meeting, which has yet to take place. Trump's latest executive order mandates that a new \"National Resilience Strategy\" be drafted, with the goal of \"reducing taxpayer burdens through efficiency.\" Project 2025, the conservative policy agenda organized by the Heritage Foundation, says the majority of disaster costs should be shouldered by the states. \"For far too long, state and local governments have neglected investing in resilience, infrastructure, and disaster preparedness because they can count on an unlimited backstop from the federal government — an unsustainable and irresponsible strategy that has resulted in needless destruction and deaths of everyday Americans,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an emailed statement. Still, many states don't want to see FEMA go away. The Trump administration's recent firings of more than 200 employees at FEMA are already likely to make the agency less able to handle future disasters. \"Our relationship with our federal partners is critical,\" North Carolina's Graney says. \"That relationship remains important and one we rely on.\" If the bulk of disaster response falls to states, some could struggle to keep up. While larger states like Florida and California have well-established emergency management offices, smaller states have few resources and staff, especially to prepare for disasters ahead of time. Infrastructure and landscape-scale projects that help protect communities from wildfires and floods are largely out of reach for local government budgets. \"Not every state had the capacity to do all the phases of emergency management, including preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation,\" says Knox. \"This is especially true in local counties in which there might be one person designated to do emergency management, especially in rural areas.\" Emergency management experts say there are areas where FEMA's disaster response efforts could be improved, especially in the complex and sometimes lengthy process for local governments to get funding for rebuilding. FEMA walks a difficult line, balancing distributing aid quickly with taking enough time to ensure there's no fraud or abuse. \"That is probably where we should be focusing most of our efforts is understanding the complexities that have developed in the way the federal government oversees money going to recovery efforts and making that simpler,\" Manning says. At a recent congressional hearing about FEMA, the director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, Jeffrey Smitherman, testified that it would be best for FEMA to handle giving out individual assistance. But he suggested that public assistance for local governments be given directly to states as a \"block grant,\" instead of being managed by FEMA. That could give states leeway to spend the money without federal oversight. Giving states funding directly also could mean that infrastructure is rebuilt with a patchwork of regulations. Under the Biden administration, projects getting federal funding were required to be built to a higher standard, constructed to withstand future flooding. The Trump administration had previously repealed that rule during its first term. Without federal guidelines to build with climate change in mind, experts say many states have little incentive to build projects better, since the financial responsibility for rebuilding after the next disaster largely falls on the federal government. \"It's malpractice as emergency managers, as government officials, to not plan for what might impact their citizens,\" Manny says. \"That's at the fundamental core of planning for disaster response.\"",

A powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake rattled much of Southeast Asia on Friday, resulting in mounting casualties and flattened skyscrapers from Myanmar to Thailand. The epicenter was in Mandalay, Myanmar, the country's second-largest city. Even Bangkok, some 600 miles away, felt widespread shaking and saw significant damage from the quake -- including the total collapse of a skyscraper under construction.   Casualties are expected to rise as search and rescue efforts are underway in collapsed buildings in Myanmar and Thailand, officials said. In Myanmar, the death toll has climbed to 2,056, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 people reported missing, according to the Myanmar Military Junta. In Bangkok, at least 13 people were killed in a building collapse in Chatuchak, according to the Bangkok Metro Authority. Reports from International Rescue Committee teams working in central Myanmar and Shan State reveal the staggering scale of humanitarian needs in the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake. IRC partners have started distributing essential support to the earthquake-hit communities, including water, hygiene kits and critical medical assistance. One of the IRC staff members working in Mandalay said they have “never experienced anything like this.”   “I have lived through several earthquakes in my life, but I have never experienced anything like this,” the staff member said. “The most powerful shaking lasted only a few seconds, and many people immediately ran out of their houses.” The staff member said many people are sleeping outside their homes on roads or open fields due to the fear of aftershocks. “There is an urgent need for tents, as even those whose homes remain intact are too afraid to sleep indoors,” the staff member said. A limited amount of water is available, telecommunication lines are “unreliable” and hospitals are overwhelmed with trauma cases, the staff member said. “Patients are being treated on beds placed outside due to fears of buildings collapsing,” the staff member said. Ciarán Donnelly, senior vice president of international programs at the IRC, told ABC News Live that teams are dealing with an “unimaginably horrendous situation on the ground,” with 80% of buildings destroyed in some towns. “The challenges are immense. You’ve got infrastructure that’s been destroyed, airports and roads that have been damaged, supply chains disrupted,” Donnelly said. -ABC News’ Will Gretsky International teams including China and Russia have already been on the ground responding to the increasingly desperate situation in Myanmar, filling the void in the U.S. absence.   Chinese teams arrived 18 hours after the earthquake, with more than 400 Chinese personnel now on the ground. On Monday, they rescued four people from collapsed buildings in Mandalay. Beijing has sent planes full of supplies, providing $14 million in aid. China also has multiple teams in Thailand. Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, said on X: “China, a friend in need.” -ABC News’ Britt Clennett The U.S. Embassy in Myanmar has announced up to $2 million to address humanitarian needs in the aftermath of last week’s earthquake, calling it part of the United States’ “immediate response” to the disaster. Additionally, a small U.S. Agency for International Development emergency response team has been deployed to assess the situation in Myanmar, but officials said that as of Monday morning, they had not yet been able to enter the country. Officials at the State Department said discussions regarding a more extensive response to the earthquake are ongoing, including the possibility of sending a Disaster Assistance Response Team. -ABC News’ Shannon K. Kingston In Myanmar, the death toll has climbed to 2,056, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 people reported missing, according to the Myanmar Military Junta. Myanmar State TV announced that seven days of national mourning begin on Monday.   The United Nations Special Envoy on Myanmar Julie Bishop called for “all sides” in Myanmar to “allow for humanitarian relief and ensure that aid workers can operate in safety,” in a statement to U.N. reporters issued Monday. “Continuing military operations in disaster-affected areas risks further loss of life and undermines the shared imperative to respond,” the statement added. -ABC News’ Joe Simonetti and Ellie Kaufman",

        "full_content": "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor. In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka. Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one. \"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve. But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say. It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives. Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events. For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Dr Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code. \"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\" With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning. The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows. The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction. It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur. Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Dr Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare. The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region. While the guess was correct, Dr Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy. There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Dr Jones said. The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet. Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\". The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come. Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis. While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region. Dr Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them. \"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\" Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade. The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.  But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.  At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030. While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur. \"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\" This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Dr Jones said. \"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said. \"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\" But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said. Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out. It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Dr Jones.  During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute. The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries. If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami. \"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division. Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert. The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

        "full_content": "State Department says dismantling USAID has not limited the U.S. response. As a U.S. team of experts heads to Myanmar to assist in recovery from the devastating earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people in Southeast Asia on Friday, international teams, including those from China and Russia, are filling the void in the U.S. absence. The U.S. said Monday that it would provide $2 million in aid and a small U.S. Agency for International Development emergency response team has been deployed to assess the situation in Myanmar, but officials said that it had not yet been able to enter the country as of Monday morning. While the dollar amount of initial aid is in line with what the U.S. has pledged in the past, the overall pace of the response has been slower. In the aftermath of the 2023 earthquake in Morocco, for example, a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team was deployed just hours later, although Morocco did not ultimately ask for DARTs. That same year when Libya endured catastrophic flooding, DARTs were deployed the same day. And when a major earthquake struck Turkey and Syria that same year, the DART teams were also launched just a few hours after the disaster hit. In both cases, the DARTs took a few days to get on the ground. The U.S. response comes amid President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle USAID, laying off thousands of employees, revoking funding for more than 80% of its programs and closing its headquarters, although those efforts are being challenged in multiple court cases. On Friday, the State Department announced it was officially shuttering the agency and taking over “many of USAID's functions and its ongoing programming.\" The State Department has pushed back on the assessment that cuts to USAID have limited the earthquake response, but officials say there has been at least some logistical impact caused by the reorganization, rather than a lack of funding. “I would reject the notion this is obviously a result of the USAID cuts and that kind of funding,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Monday. “We’re certainly in the region.” In the meantime, it was Chinese teams that arrived 18 hours after the quake and more than 400 Chinese personnel are now on the ground in the region. Beijing has sent in planes full of supplies, providing $14 million in aid. China also has multiple teams in Thailand. It’s a public relations win for China, showing it can be a reliable partner when its neighbors are in crisis. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Monday posted on X photos and videos of Chinese workers on the ground, rescuing survivors and delivering supplies, saying, “China, a friend in need.” A leading aid group said in a statement to ABC News on Tuesday that the U.S. has already “missed the first urgent window to help find survivors.” Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, blamed the Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID for what she characterized as the U.S.’s “severely compromised” emergency response. \"For decades, the US Government has responded to sudden onset emergencies primarily by providing humanitarian support through USAID. With USAID effectively gutted and critical staff receiving their final notices in the midst of an emergency, the US Government’s ability to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar and future crises is severely compromised,\" Maxman said. \"Speed, collaboration, and resources are life and death matters when disaster strikes. The illegal decision to dismantle USAID means the U.S. will be unable to show up like it has in past emergencies.\" At the site where a high-rise building collapsed on Sunday in Bangkok, a group of U.S. military personnel were coming and going from the search area throughout Monday. The American team is working with Israeli soldiers to search for survivors, sending drones into areas too dangerous for rescue workers to reach. “We’re learning a lot from the Americans, and they’re bringing in a lot of good equipment,” said Choktong Issarangkool, one of the volunteers in the rescue and search teams who is also acting as a translator for the American teams. Thais say they are grateful for the American assistance, something this region has become accustomed to following a natural disaster: U.S. aid teams have always been among the first on the ground to help. State Department officials said discussions regarding a more extensive response to the earthquake are ongoing, including the possibility of sending a DART team, although it might be smaller than in past efforts. “Our disaster experts, including those based in Bangkok, Manila and Washington, D.C., continue to monitor the situation with coordination with U.S. government counterparts in the region,” Bruce said. She emphasized that the $2 million of initial support would be implemented through partner organizations that were already working in the impacted areas. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "full_content": "BANGKOK — A powerful earthquake rocked Myanmar on Friday, causing extensive damage across a wide swath of one of the world’s poorest countries and prompting officials to warn that the initial death toll — above 140 — was likely to grow in the days ahead. In neighboring Thailand, at least six died in Bangkok, where a high-rise under construction collapsed. The full extent of death, injury and destruction was not immediately clear — particularly in Myanmar, which is embroiled in a civil war, and where information is tightly controlled. Advertisement Advertisement “The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,” the head of Myanmar’s military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said as he announced on television that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others were injured in his country. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand In Thailand, authorities in Bangkok said six people were killed, 22 were injured and 101 were missing from three construction sites, including the high-rise. They revised the death toll Saturday morning from 10 reported the previous day, saying several critically injured people were mistakenly reported dead. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said that more people were believed to be alive in the wreckage as search efforts continued Saturday morning. The 7.7 magnitude quake struck at midday, with an epicenter near Mandalay, Myanmar ’s second-largest city. Aftershocks followed, one of them measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude. Myanmar is in an active earthquake belt, though many of the temblors happen in sparsely populated areas, not cities like those affected Friday. The U.S. Geological Survey, an American government science agency, estimated that the death toll could top 1,000. In Mandalay, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including one of the city’s largest monasteries. Photos from the capital city of Naypyidaw showed rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of multiple buildings used to house civil servants. Myanmar's government said blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept assistance. A 37-member team from the Chinese province of Yunnan reached the city of Yangon early Saturday with earthquake detectors, drones and other supplies, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Russia’s emergencies ministry dispatched two planes carrying 120 rescuers and supplies, according to a report from the Russian state news agency Tass. India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team as well as blankets, tarpaulin, hygiene kits, sleeping bags, solar lamps, food packets and kitchen sets, the country’s foreign minister posted on X. Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country will send 50 people on Sunday to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas. The United Nations allocated $5 million to start relief efforts. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response, but some experts were concerned about this effort given his administration’s deep cuts in foreign assistance. But amid images of buckled and cracked roads and reports of a collapsed bridge and a burst dam, there were concerns about how rescuers would even reach some areas in a country already enduring a humanitarian crisis. “We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,\" said Mohammed Riyas, the International Rescue Committee’s Myanmar director. Myanmar's English-language state newspaper, Global New Light of Myanmar, said five cities and towns had seen building collapses and two bridges had fallen, including one on a key highway between Mandalay and Yangon. A photo on the newspaper’s website showed wreckage of a sign that read “EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT,\" which the caption said was part of the capital’s main 1,000-bed hospital. Elsewhere, video posted online showed robed monks in a Mandalay street, shooting their own video of the multistory Ma Soe Yane monastery before it suddenly fell into the ground. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed. Video also showed damage to the former royal palace. Christian Aid said its partners and colleagues on the ground reported that a dam burst in the city, causing water levels to rise in the lowland areas. Residents of Yangon, the nation's largest city, rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. In Naypyitaw, some homes stood partly crumbled, while rescuers heaved away bricks from the piles of debris. An injured man reclined on a wheeled stretcher, while another man fanned him in the heat. In a country where many people already were struggling, “this disaster will have left people devastated,” said Julie Mehigan, who oversees Christian Aid’s work in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. “Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,” Mehigan said. Myanmar's military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones. Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. In Thailand, a 33-story building under construction crumpled into a cloud of dust near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market, and onlookers could be seen screaming and running in a video posted on social media. Vehicles on a nearby freeway came to a stop. Sirens blared across the Thai capital's downtown as a rescuers streamed to the wreckage. Above them, shredded steel and broken concrete blocks, some stacked like pancakes, rose in a towering heap. Injured people were rushed away on gurneys, and hospital beds were also wheeled outside onto a sidewalk. “It’s a great tragedy,\" Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit said after viewing the site. Earthquakes are rarely felt in the Bangkok metropolitan area, home to more than 17 million people, many of whom live in high-rise apartments. Voranoot Thirawat, a lawyer working in central Bangkok, said she first realized something was wrong when she saw a light swinging back and forth. Then she heard the building creaking, and she and her colleagues fled down 12 flights of stairs. “In my lifetime, there was no earthquake like this in Bangkok,” she said. Fraser Morton, a tourist from Scotland, was in one of Bangkok’s many malls when the quake struck. “All of a sudden, the whole building began to move. Immediately, there was screaming and a lot of panic,” he said. Some people fled down upward-moving escalators, he said. Nearby, Paul Vincent, a tourist visiting from England, recalled seeing a high-rise building swaying, water falling from a rooftop pool and people crying in the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey and Germany’s GFZ center for geosciences said the earthquake was a shallow 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to preliminary reports. Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more damage. To the northeast, the earthquake was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused damage and injuries in the city of Ruili on the border with Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports. The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. —Adam Schreck, Haruka Naga, Jerry Harmer, Grant Peck and Penny Wang in Bangkok, Jamey Keaten in Geneva, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Edith M.

Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Overnight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls \"major flood stage,\" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. There were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. Interstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts, twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. \"We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,\" he said. \n                A flooded home is seen from the banks of the Ohio River on Saturday in Louisville, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. Hundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. Downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said. \"We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,\" Knight said. \"Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.\" In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding. BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen. \n                The rising waters of the Licking River touch the basketball hoop at Max Goldberg Park, Saturday, April 5, 2025, in Falmouth, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Since Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage. \"I grabbed all my stuff and came here,\" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: \"I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.\"",

        "full_content": "Fighting has been reported in Myanmar despite the military junta and a rebel group alliance announcing temporary ceasefires to support earthquake relief. As of Friday, the military had carried out at least 14 attacks since the ceasefire, according to reports received by the UN Human Rights office. The military accused two rebel groups in the alliance that declared a ceasefire of carrying out attacks. One group said fighting broke out in response to \"offensives\" by the military.  Maj Gen Zaw Min Tun, military council spokesman, issued a general statement saying \"we will respond if military bases are attacked without reason\". An army spokesman did not respond to BBC Burmese's request for comment.  UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk urged \"a halt to all military operations\" and a focus \"on assisting those impacted by the quake, as well as ensuring unhindered access to humanitarian organisations\" following the 7.7 magnitude quake on 28 March. A civil war has been ongoing between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. The military council declared a 20-day ceasefire on 2 April, after the alliance made up of three rebel groups had announced one. The official death toll from the earthquake in Myanmar rose to 3,564 on Monday, according to state media. Another 5,012 people were injured and 210 people remain missing. More than a week after the earthquake, rescue workers were recovering bodies from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Mandalay over the weekend, state media reported. Rain also fell over the weekend, which aid groups said could hamper relief efforts. The UN Human Rights office said on Friday that while humanitarian efforts had progressed in areas where access had been granted, \"longstanding limitations imposed by the military on humanitarian operations and access\" meant that multiple badly affected areas \"have remained inaccessible to humanitarian emergency assistance – except for what can be organised locally by residents\". UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said in a video filmed in Mandalay on Saturday that people \"need food. They need water. They need the power back on. They're telling me that they need shelter\". Aftershocks continue, with a 4.9 magnitude earthquake recorded over the weekend, and people are \"living with that trauma\", he said. Before the earthquake, almost 20 million people were already in need in this community, he added. \"So it's a compounding crisis. It's earthquake, on top of conflict, on top of huge existing need,\" he said.",

        "full_content": "In the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, there is a 72-hour \"golden window\" when those trapped under rubble are most likely to survive. But in the 72 hours after a 7.7 magnitude quake struck Myanmar on Friday, rescue and relief workers seeking access to some of the worst-hit areas were blocked by military authorities, multiple aid and human rights groups told the BBC. This was despite a rare plea for international humanitarian assistance by junta chief Min Aung Hlaing. \"I would like to invite any country, any organisation, or anyone in Myanmar to come and help,\" he said in a speech shortly after the disaster, claiming he had \"opened all ways for foreign aid\". On the ground, things moved less freely. \"I've talked to a few people now that were part of the rescue efforts in both Sagaing and Mandalay, and they said that [the military] imposed a curfew… the roads were blocked, the checkpoints were really long, and there was a huge checking of goods and services going in and a lot of questioning,\" John Quinley, director of international human rights group Fortify Rights, told the BBC. \"It could have just been a lot easier to allow those people in,\" he added. \"Obviously the Myanmar junta said it was for safety reasons, but I don't believe that's totally legitimate.\" Meanwhile, the golden window closed. At the time of writing, more than 2,886 people in Myanmar are confirmed dead as a result of the earthquake. On Tuesday night, an attack on an aid convoy further exacerbated concerns. At 21:21, a convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross Society vehicles carrying earthquake relief supplies was attacked by the military, according to Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), a resistance group in Shan State. The convoy was traveling toward Mandalay when it was fired upon by soldiers with machine guns, forcing it to turn back, the TNLA said in a Telegram post late on Tuesday. A junta spokesperson later confirmed that soldiers had shot at the vehicles, saying they had not been notified that the convoy would be passing through and fired warning shots after it failed to stop. But this is not the first time the junta has attacked aid workers, Mr Quinley said. \"They pick and choose when aid can go in, and if they can't monitor it and they can't use it how they want, they restrict it,\" he said. \"They definitely also, on top of that, actively target humanitarian workers.\"  The junta, which began fighting a civil war with resistance forces in Myanmar after it seized control of the country in 2021, has a history of weaponising aid and humanitarian assistance: funnelling it towards areas that are under its control and restricting it in areas that are not. The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November last year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict. In previous natural disasters, such as Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Typhoon Yagi in 2024, which left hundreds dead, the military obstructed relief efforts in resistance-held areas by refusing to release supplies from customs, authorise travel for aid workers or relax restrictions on lifesaving assistance. \"It's a worrying trend that happens in times of crisis, like the earthquake,\" Mr Quinley said. \"The junta is blocking any aid to what they see as groups that are aligned with the broader resistance.\" James Rodehaver, head of the Myanmar team at the Office for the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, further suggested that the junta deprives Myanmar's population of aid as a form of punishment. \"They do that because the local population, by and large, does not support them, so by depriving them of humanitarian aid, they are both punishing them but also cutting off their ability to support themselves and be resilient,\" he told the BBC. There are already signs the junta may be repeating this tactic in Sagaing. Although central Myanmar, which includes the cities of Sagaing and Mandalay, is nominally run by the junta - meaning aid can only be delivered to the area with their co-operation - large parts of the broader Sagaing and Mandalay regions are considered resistance strongholds. The likelihood that the junta might tactically deprive these areas of aid has prompted outcry from hundreds of human rights and civil society organisations, who have urged the international community to ensure relief efforts get to where they're most needed, and aren't channelled through the military government. One such statement, signed by 265 civil society organisations and released on Sunday, notes that most of the worst-hit areas are under the effective control and administration of pro-democracy resistance groups. \"Myanmar's history provides stark warnings about the dangers of channelling aid through the military junta,\" it reads. In Sagaing, the impact of aid shortfalls can already be seen in troubling ways, according to relief agencies. They speak of shortages of food, water and fuel, while trucks carrying aid are stranded at military checkpoints around the city. Hundreds of residents, suddenly homeless, are sleeping outside on the street. Rescue volunteers who were forced to dig through the rubble with their bare hands have run out of body bags for those they couldn't save. Other community members seeking to respond to the earthquake are being forced to get authorisation from junta authorities by submitting lists of volunteers and items to be donated, local media reported. This tactic – of bombarding responders with lengthy bureaucratic checklists and processes – is routinely deployed by the junta to restrict the activities of international aid organisations in Myanmar, humanitarian sources told the BBC. According to a registration law imposed in 2023, such organisations must attain a registration certificate, and often sign a memorandum of understanding with relevant government ministries, to legally operate inside the country. One source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said aid groups are often required to remove certain activities, areas or townships from their proposals, with no room for negotiation. Areas where the junta doesn't have oversight or control over the aid work are typically those that are disallowed, they added. Aid agencies have found ways to navigate the junta's restriction, however: a lot of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar happens underground, via local groups that can bypass checkpoints and distribute aid without attracting the attention of the authorities. Many financial transactions in humanitarian aid also happen outside of Myanmar's banking system, so that actors can avoid scrutiny and potential investigation from the country's central bank, a source told the BBC. In some cases, humanitarian organisations open bank accounts in Thailand so that they can privately receive aid funds, then carry the money over the border into Myanmar in cash. Such covert methods take time, however, and could lead to potentially fatal delays of days or weeks.  Some aid workers are hopeful that, given the scale of Friday's earthquake and the international appeal for assistance by Min Aung Hlaing, it may be easier to overcome barriers and provide aid more efficiently. \"In the past we have faced some challenges,\" said Louise Gorton, an emergency specialist based in Unicef's East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. \"The scale of this emergency, though, is significantly higher… I think there will be pressure on the regime to ensure unfettered and unimpeded humanitarian access - and we'll continue to repeat the same need and find ways, sometimes low-key ways, to deliver aid.\" Another aid worker, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while it's too early to tell whether the junta will truly \"open all ways for foreign aid\", their team is prepared to navigate the complex humanitarian situation to deliver assistance. \"It's certainly a concern that they [the military] may direct the aid in specific places, and not based on need.\" \"But as humanitarian actors [our organisation] works under a humanitarian mandate, and will be very focused on getting aid to the places it needs to go - to the hardest-hit areas, regardless of who controls them.\" Early indications suggest that, despite Min Aung Hlaing's plea to the international community, the embattled junta leader is unlikely to prioritise the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid.  Shortly after the earthquake, military jets launched a series of airstrikes on affected areas, killing more than 50 civilians, according to the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC). Then, on Tuesday, Min Aung Hlaing rejected ceasefire proposals that were put forward by resistance groups in a bid to facilitate aid. Military operations would continue as \"necessary protective measures\", he said. The junta changed its mind a day later, agreeing to a 20-day ceasefire to help relief efforts. But it remains to be seen whether the pause in hostilities will hold. The military stressed it would \"respond accordingly\" if rebels launched attacks. For many onlookers, this seeming contradiction - of asking for aid with one hand while conducting military strikes with the other - chimes with Min Aung Hlaing's history of duplicity. John Quinley, from Fortify Rights, noted that the junta leader has \"lied on numerous occasions\" - and suggested that the recent appeal for foreign aid is more likely an appeal for international recognition. Against that backdrop, Mr Quinley added, it's critical to ensure earthquake relief gets to where it is most needed. \"I think as a human rights group we need to monitor: OK, [Min Aung Hlaing] allows aid in - but is it actually reaching people in need? Or is he weaponising the aid? Is he blocking the aid from getting to communities in need?\" he said. \"I'm not hopeful when it comes to taking what Min Aung Hlaing says with any hint of truth.\"",

        "full_content": "Days after multiple tornadoes tore through the state, parts of Tennessee are bracing for a possible once in a 1,000 year rain event. A storm system is ripping through the central United States, potentially dropping more than 10 inches of rain in some communities, including in parts of West Tennessee. The latest predictions from AccuWeather, the storm is expected to dump the equivalent of up to four months' worth of rain over a five-day period. \"Should the amount of rain occur that we anticipate over the middle of the nation, it would exceed the 500 to 1,000-year average,\" AccuWeather meteorologist William Clark said, \"Truly, the potential is there for a historic flash flooding event.\" This rain event and other storm systems are expected to impact a 1,000-mile swath from Texas to Ohio, according to Accuweather. Parts of the U.S. could see \"generational\" rain amounts and, along with it, flash floods and even possibly tornadoes. “People who have lived in a community their entire lives may see water rapidly rising and flooding areas they have never seen flood before,\" AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. \"Do not assume that if you have not seen flooding in an area before, that it will not occur this time.” Here's how Tennessee is expected to fare as this \"generational\" rain event moves across the U.S. Where is 'Dixie Alley'? Term looks at shift in 'tornado alley' to the southeast Western Tennessee is expected to get the brunt of these storm systems, with some meteorologist predicting upwards of a foot of rain to fall in the Memphis area over the next five days. The National Weather Service also expects areas of the mid-Mississippi and lower Ohio valleys to see a tornado outbreak starting Wednesday into the night. A tornado outbreak is expected today and tonight from parts of the mid Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys westward into the eastern Ozarks. Numerous tornadoes, along with multiple long-track EF3+ tornadoes appear likely. In addition, tornadoes, severe wind gusts, and large hail… pic.twitter.com/Uv39fjwK0O Here are the different hazardous weather advisories already in place by the weather service: Memphis, West Tennessee: Wind advisory until midnight on Wednesday and a flood watch until 7 a.m. Sunday, April 6. Nashville, Middle Tennessee: Wind advisory until 4 a.m. on Thursday, April 3, and a flood watch until 7 a.m. Sunday, April 6. The National Weather Service warns that Tennesseans in these communities should be prepared for severe weather, including the potential for significant rain, flash flooding, large hail, straight line winds and even tornadoes. We are still forecasting a severe threat for this evening and overnight. All modes of severe weather remain possible today, including damaging winds, large hail, tornadoes, & flooding.NOW is the time to make sure you have multiple ways to receive warnings! (2/6) pic.twitter.com/rOoikJR0lD West and Middle Tennessee are expected to see rain starting late Wednesday afternoon and it will continue through the weekend. Significant rain is expected during this time, and communities in Middle and West Tennessee should be prepared for possible flooding during this event. Here's how many inches of rain are predicted for some areas as of Wednesday morning. Union City: 10-15 inches Along and north of I-40 in West Tennessee: 10-15 inches Memphis, Shelby County: 8-10 inches Clarksville: 8-10 inches Stewart, Montgomery, and Houston counties: 6-10 inches Waverly: 6-8 inches Nashville: 5-6 inches East Tennessee will be spared the brunt of the storm but could see rain and severe storms this weekend. The National Weather Service out of Memphis referred to these storm systems' potential to bring \"generational flooding\" to the area. This usually refers to an event that usually only happens once in a generation...or a once-in-a-lifetime event. People in East Tennessee and western North Carolina saw similar flooding after Tropical Storm Helene dumped massive amounts of rain in those communities, which caused rivers to crest to historic levels and cut a swath of destruction that has forever changed those communities. Keep up to date with the latest weather warnings below. When a tornado watch is in place tornadoes are possible in and near the watch area, according to the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service suggests people who are in the warning area review and discuss their emergency plans, check supplies and have a safe room incase the weather takes a turn for the worse. When a tornado warning is issued, it means a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. There is imminent danger to life and property. Here are some suggestions from the National Weather Service if a tornado warning is issued for your area: Warnings typically are for a much smaller area that may be impacted by a tornado identified by a forecaster on radar, a trained spotter or law enforcement who is watching the storm, according to the National Weather Service. Tornado warnings are issued by your local forecast office. Flash flooding usually begins within six hours, but often within three hours, of heavy rain or mass amounts of water accumulating in an area, according to the National Weather Service. This type of flooding usually happens very quickly and catches people off guard. It can be caused by a number of things, but is often due to extremely heavy rainfall from thunderstorms. \"The intensity of the rainfall, the location and distribution of the rainfall, the land use and topography, vegetation types and growth/density, soil type, and soil water-content all determine just how quickly the flash flooding may occur, and influence where it may occur,\" writes the National Weather Service. A flood watch and a flood warning are two different things. Here's the difference. A flood watch indicates that the conditions are favorable to flooding in an area that is under a watch. These flood watches are usually issued hours and even days ahead of the weather event that could cause the flooding.  A flood warning means that the flooding that could be harmful and poses a serious threat to property and people is expected. This too can be issued hours and days ahead of time based on forecast predictions. Anytime flooding is a risk people should use caution. Water levels can change rapidly during periods of heavy rainfall. This story was updated to add a video and gallery.",

        "full_content": "Towards the end of last year, we learned that a group (allegedly affiliated with the Chinese government, referred to as “Salt Typhoon”) breached T-Mobile and other telecommunications companies and caused all sorts of havoc. This isn’t really a blog post about that incident, but it was the catalyst that inspired a bit of curiosity within me. I can’t (legally) access most mobile phone companies’ networks to see what vulnerabilities I can find, but there are plenty of open source software projects related to telecommunications on GitHub. So when I heard about the Salt Typhoon hacks, I wondered, “Is any of this open source telecom software any good?” In a previous life, I worked with companies that used Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, but I’d never really looked into them beyond the surface-level familiarity congruent to “this uses a similar protocol as RedPhone, somewhere” (this was when Signal was still called TextSecure). I don’t know much about PBX systems, SIP, or even audio encoding. Furthermore, some of the best C programmers I’ve ever met worked in telecom. Hell, some of the longest-running hacker communities have their roots in phone phreaking from the 1980s. Not to mention all the legendary engineers that trace their roots to Bell Labs. This is all to say, I thought looking at this sort of software would be a fruitless endeavor.  Surely all of the low-hanging fruit would be found already? Thus, I opened FreeSWITCH’s source code on GitHub and almost immediately found a vulnerability. In this excerpt of code, the HTTP request handler for the XMLRPC library bundled with FreeSWITCH writes an arbitrary-length URI to a 4096-byte stack variable called z. The uri variable is populated by the path part of the Request URI, which is attacker-provided. This is not typically a problem, since most browsers don’t support URLs longer than 2048 characters, but the relevant RFCs support up to about 8 KB in most cases. (CloudFlare supports up to 32KB.) I think it’s reasonable to assume that attackers are capable of sending a Request URI longer than 4096 characters. Putting these observations together, it’s pretty easy to see this is a no-auth buffer overflow in their XMLRPC library.  Turning this into remote code execution is an exercise left to the reader (mostly because I’m not really up-to-date on OS-level exploit mitigation techniques, and how to bypass them). Use snprintf() instead. This is kind of “defensive C programming practices 101” level. (n.b., Please stop saying “responsible” disclosure.) 2025-01-27: I send an email on to the email address listed on FreeSWITCH’s security policy with the details of the vulnerability. 2025-02-07: I send a follow-up email to ensure they received my report. 2025-02-07: Andrey Volk responds: Hello Soatok. Thank you for your email! Issues you describe were recently fixed. Please see: https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/pull/2752 https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/pull/2753 https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/pull/2754 Best regards, Since the fixes are now public, I’m left to assume that “embargo has broken,” so to speak. That means I’m free to blog about this publicly. However, I notice they haven’t tagged a new release with this security fix for FreeSWITCH users. I reply: Oh, wonderful. Thanks for getting back to me. Do you have an ETA on when the release will be tagged? I don’t want to publish anything until people can easily install an updated version. A few hours later, Andrey responds to my email. Brace yourselves, it’s a stupid one. … Hello Soatok. Thank you for your interest in FreeSWITCH. We do not have plans to make a release of FreeSWITCH Community till summer 2025. Best regards, To recap: An employee of SignalWire (which develops FreeSWITCH) came right out and said they would let people who aren’t paying for FreeSWITCH Advantage stay vulnerable until their regularly scheduled release (sometime in the Summer). There are about 8,300 hits on Shodan for FreeSWITCH as I write this. I highly doubt they’re all paying for enterprise support, so we’re talking about potentially thousands of telecom stacks around the world that SignalWire has decided to keep vulnerable until the Summer, even after they published the patches on GitHub. While such a decision might be perfectly legal, it really does not inspire trust in the stewards of this software project to give a shit about the harm their careless coding practices inflict upon their users. The worst part is, when I confided in a friend that works in telecom (after SignalWire published the fixes, of course) about this carnival-quality vulnerability management from the FreeSWITCH developers, their response was: That fast? […] December 2024 is the last time that alarms were once again raised about known SS7 vulnerabilities that have continued to exist in telephone networks for the past 17 years. And, to be honest, that kind of took the wind out of my sails so I didn’t bother looking at Asterisk or any of the other software. I mean, why bother? I already had the answer to the question that prompted me to look in the first place: Telecom security sucks today. The reason things sucks is largely because there’s very little (if any) money to be made in securing these systems today. Things don’t have to be this way, of course. Maybe there’s some opportunity for some enterprising young hacker to write a FreeSWITCH competitor in Rust that has sane vulnerability management around it. (Or, at least, is marginally harder to find vulnerabilities in than Damn Vulnerable Web Application. Maybe the OpenBSD team can be inspired to act?) Maybe in the future, we’ll find the political will to invest in the security of America’s telecommunications infrastructure. Who knows, some of that money might even percolate towards open source software, and they can hire someone who knows how to run valgrind. Or maybe everything will continue to suck, because incentives rule anything, and there currently aren’t any to do better. It took me a long time to write this one up, despite it being a rather simple technical issue, because I’m sure there are eldritch horrors lurking beneath the surface of this relatively simple finding. The vendor’s response was pretty lame, yeah. But is this vendor the lamest in their industry? I’m not so sure about that one. At least they responded within 90 days and fixed the issue on their GitHub. But, hey, if you’re waiting on SignalWire to get around to running git tag… maybe rebuild from source or block public HTTP access to your FreeSWITCH stack at the firewall level? Sorry I can’t help more.  Security engineer with a fursona. Ask me about dholes or Diffie-Hellman!",

The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that communities should prepare for two more days of excessive rainfall, which could lead to additional \"historic\" flooding. At least eight people have already lost their lives due to the severe storm systems, including a young boy in Frankfort, Ky., who was swept away by floodwaters while walking to his school bus, according to the state's governor, Andy Beshear. Kentucky, I have some tough news to share. This morning in Frankfort, a child died after being swept away by floodwaters. My heart breaks for this family. Please join Britainy and me in praying for them following this unimaginable loss. 1/2 \"We need everyone to understand that all water poses a risk right now. Let's do everything possible to keep our loved ones safe,\" Beshear wrote on X. Frankfort Police have identified the boy as 9-year-old Gabriel Andrews. \"We would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family of this young boy,\" Assistant Chief of Police Scott Tracy said during a press conference. \"Our prayers are with them.\" Beshear also offered his condolences, stating, \"My heart breaks for the family.\" He urged the community to pray for Gabriel's family, highlighting that this tragedy underscores just how dangerous floodwaters can be. Among the other victims of the recent severe weather is 68-year-old Garry Moore from Missouri.  Missouri State Highway Patrol authorities informed local media that Moore was the chief of the Whitewater Fire Protection District and was killed while assisting a stranded motorist.  In Indiana, the Hendricks County Sheriff's Office reported the death of a 27-year-old man who died after coming into contact with downed power lines on the road. His name has not yet been released. Additionally, officials in Tennessee reported five other fatalities attributed to the severe weather. During a press conference on Thursday evening, Gov. Bill Lee described a tornado that tore through the area as causing \"immense devastation.\" Kentucky, as well as Tennessee, have been approved for federal disaster relief as a result of the storms. Arkansas, which has been heavily impacted by the severe weather, has requested approval for FEMA relief. Areas around 45 river locations are expected to reach major flood stage, and an additional 112 are expected to reach moderate flood stage, according to the NWS.

Some areas could see up to 10-15 inches of rain. \"This will especially be the case for the Lower Ohio Valley into the Mid-South and Lower Mississippi Valley, where the necessary ingredients of moisture, instability, forcing, and wind shear best overlap,\" the agency said.   In severe weather conditions, forcing or lift mechanisms, such as a cold front, dry line, or terrain, are needed to trigger rising air and initiate thunderstorm development. These same conditions have also contributed to severe tornadoes that have ravaged the region, leaving entire communities devastated in their aftermath.

        "full_content": "A huge 7.7 magnitude earthquake has hit central Myanmar, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). At least 144 people have died and 732 have been injured so far in the country, Myanmar military leader Min Aung Hlaing said. The epicentre was 16km (10 miles) north-west of the city of Sagaing, sending strong tremors that were felt as far as south-west China and Thailand. Meanwhile, around 100 construction workers are missing after an unfinished high-rise building collapsed hundreds of miles away in Bangkok, according to Thailand's deputy prime minister. At least seven people have died at the site in Thailand, according to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. A rescuer in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, told the BBC the damage is \"enormous\".  The total number of people killed and injured by the earthquake are expected to rise in the coming days. There have been reports of roads buckling in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw, and the country's military government has declared a state of emergency in six regions. The earthquake struck near Mandalay, which has a population of about 1.5 million people.  A second quake struck 12 minutes after the first, according to the USGS, with a magnitude of 6.4 and its epicentre was 18km (11.1 miles) south of Sagaing. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gained independence from Britain in 1948, but its recent history has been marked by unrest and conflict. The military seized power in 2021, ten years after agreeing to hand over control to a civilian government. Since then, the junta has cracked down hard on dissent, executing democracy activists and jailing journalists. The state controls almost all local radio, television, print and online media, and Internet use is restricted in the country, which often makes access to information difficult. According to a recent BBC data project, the country is now controlled by a patchwork of groups, making relief and recovery efforts more challenging.  It is even harder to find accurate information about what is going on in rebel-held areas of the country. The junta made a rare call for international assistance in the wake of the earthquake.  However, the complex situation on the ground is likely to hamper search and rescue operations as well as the free flow of aid into the country. Rescue workers operating in villages near Mandalay have told the BBC they do not have access to the heavy machinery needed to reach people trapped under the rubble. \"We're digging people out with our bare hands,\" one man said. The earthquake has added pressure to an already dire humanitarian situation in the country, where 3.5m people are estimated to have been displaced by fighting. The Sagaing region, near the epicentre of the quake, is a volatile key battleground in the civil war. Charities and opposition parties working in the country have raised concerns about the \"politicisation\" of aid in the coming days.  Montse Ferrer, the deputy director of East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific at Amnesty International, told the BBC the junta has \"a history of denying aid\" to areas where resistance forces are active. The tremors were felt hundreds of miles away in Thailand's capital of Bangkok, where rescue teams worked through the night to free the construction workers trapped beneath the rubble. Buildings across the city were evacuated, including a hospital holding patients in acute need of medical attention. A woman gave birth on the street amid the commotion, lying on a stretcher surrounded by hospital staff. Bui Thu, a BBC journalist who lives in Bangkok, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme that she was at home cooking when the initial quake happened. \"I was very nervous, I was very panicked,\" she said.  \"Buildings in Bangkok are not engineered for earthquakes, so I think that's why I think there's going to be big damage.\" Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra visited the site of the collapsed building on Friday afternoon.  Search and rescue teams using drones, sniffer dogs and diggers have been mobilised and disaster centres set up to help with the rescue operation.

        "full_content": "Chinese automaker BYD continues to leave Tesla in the dust. The company introduced a new battery system on Monday that it claims can charge an electric vehicle in just five minutes, about the same time it takes to refuel a combustion car. The feat has long been a goal of the industry, which is still trying to overcome thorny hurdles around charging that have held potential buyers back. The company specifically claims it can provide 249 miles of range in 5 minutes in its new Han L sedan. That compares to Tesla’s best charging rate, which can add 170 miles of range in 15 minutes at one of its high-voltage Superchargers. Elon Musk years ago bet big on an in-house battery to provide extended range to his company’s vehicles, but seemingly found battery development is harder than expected, as the 4860 battery has not lived up to expectations. BYDâs stock rose on the news to reach a market value of roughly $158 billion. It is up approximately 58% so far this year. There has been some concern raised that fast charging such as that from BYD could shorten the overall lifespan of an EV battery, but there is little evidence thus far to support that idea. There are also concerns about how such charging could strain electrical grids. The CEO of major Chinese battery maker CATL last year said Musk “doesn’t know how to make a battery” in an interview with Reuters. BYD, now the leading EV maker in China, was founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturing company, and only later entered the automotive market as it saw the future of cars would be as computers on wheels. It also assembles iPads for Apple. The company makes EVs at a range of prices, with its most affordable Seagull coming in at a starting price of just $9,700. It has been expanding across the world into markets like Europe and South America, building China’s soft power by creating local jobs and proving it can be successful outside the domestic Chinese market. This all comes as Musk looks to handicap U.S. automotive companies by getting rid of subsidies that were helping the industry transition. Critics of China have complained that it uses subsidies to flood foreign markets with cheap products, but BYD is profitable on EVs now, and U.S. automakers could do the same if they had more time to reach scale. America was once a leader in automotive globally, but has decided to cede that position to China in favor of AI and crypto. The transition to EVs has come with more growing pains than many in the industry expected, as charging infrastructure has been slow to expand and available chargers are frequently broken or slow. The existing infrastructure around gas-powered vehicles was developed over decades, however, and it makes sense it would similarly take time for EVs to reach maturity. Fast-charging capabilities could placate drivers who do not want to sit at chargers for a long time. Besides leapfrogging Tesla on price and battery performance, BYD also recently announced it will be adding advanced self-driving features to all of its vehicles. Reviewers have lauded BYDâs system for its performance. It should all serve as a reminder that Tesla’s current valuation does not make a lot of sense. Sales have been cratering globally, the company sells fewer vehicles than BMW at lower profit margins, its vehicle lineup is dated, and full autonomy is years late. But Musk has pivoted to self-driving robocabs and robotics to keep the valuation afloat. Tesla stock has fallen 40% since the start of 2025 in part over intense backlash to Muskâs close involvement in the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Ross Gerber, one of Tesla’s most loyal investors called for Musk to step down from his position as CEO at the company. Perhaps if he was not spending all his time in Washington, Musk would have more time for Tesla, once the leader in electric vehicles but now second-tier compared to BYD. The power and proximity to President Trump is more valuable to him, it seems. It is certainly sad to think how much further ahead Tesla would be today if it had a full-time CEO not making the brand toxic. \nbatteriesbydChinaTESLA  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Tesla's presentation last year for a Cybercab gave sci-fi dystopia vibes that drew concern from Alcon Entertainment.\n         \n          China's response to tariffs could hit Hollywood.\n         \n          Navarro said Musk wasn't a manufacturer of cars, just an \"assembler.\"\n         \n          The president just keeps introducing more chaos.\n         \n          The president said China was \"not happy\" with his tariffs, which are currently decimating the U.S. stock market.\n         \n          The 10% baseline tariffs will hit April 5, with the larger tariffs coming into effect April 9.",

Forecasters warned that rivers in some places would continue to rise for days. Overnight into Sunday morning there were new tornado warnings issued in Alabama and Mississippi, along with flash flood warnings in several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. Day after day of heavy rains have pounded the central U.S., rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies in from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service said dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach what the agency calls \"major flood stage,\" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible. At least 16 weather-related deaths have been reported since the start of the storms, including 10 in Tennessee. A 57-year-old man died Friday evening after getting out of a car that washed off a road in West Plains, Missouri. Flooding killed two people in Kentucky including a 9-year-old boy swept away that same day on his way to school and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a fully submerged vehicle in Nelson County, authorities said. Also Saturday, a 5-year-old died at a home in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a weather-related incident, according to police. No details were immediately provided. Tornadoes earlier in the week destroyed entire neighborhoods and were responsible for at least seven of the deaths. There were 521 flights cancelled and more than 6,400 flights delayed within the U.S. or coming into or leaving the country on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. Interstate commerce also could be affected. The extreme flooding across a corridor that includes the major cargo hubs in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could lead to shipping and supply chain delays, said Jonathan Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather. The outburst comes at a time when nearly half of NWS forecast offices have 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts, twice that of just a decade ago. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday that the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) in 24 hours and would continue to swell for days. \"We expect this to be one of the top 10 flooding events in Louisville history,\" he said. \n                A flooded home is seen from the banks of the Ohio River on Saturday in Louisville, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Cherry/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Flash flood emergency and tornado warnings continued to be issued Saturday across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, with more heavy rains and damaging winds in the mix. All of eastern Kentucky was under a flood watch through Sunday morning. Hundreds of Kentucky roads across the state were impassable because of floodwaters, downed trees or mud and rock slides. Downtown Hopkinsville, Kentucky, reopened in the morning after floodwaters from the Little River receded, giving a much-needed reprieve, but still more rainfall was on its way, Mayor James R. Knight Jr. said. \"We got a little rain, but most of it went north of us,\" Knight said. \"Thank goodness on that. Gave us a little break.\" In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the rising Licking River. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years ago when the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed. In Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with people to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary due to widespread flooding. BNSF Railway confirmed that a railroad bridge in Mammoth Spring was washed out by floodwaters, causing the derailment of several cars. No injuries were reported, but there was no immediate estimate for when the bridge would reopen. \n                The rising waters of the Licking River touch the basketball hoop at Max Goldberg Park, Saturday, April 5, 2025, in Falmouth, Ky.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Since Wednesday, more than a foot of rain (30.5 centimeters) has fallen in parts of Kentucky, and more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) in parts of Arkansas and Missouri, forecasters said Saturday. Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong wind shear and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf. At least two reports of observed tornadoes were noted Friday evening in Missouri and Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. One, near Blytheville, Arkansas, lofted debris at least 25,000 feet (7.6 kilometers) high, according to NWS meteorologist Chelly Amin. The state's emergency management office reported damage in 22 counties from tornadoes, wind, hail and flash flooding. In Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived Saturday at a storm shelter near a public school in the rain, clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Among them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage. \"I grabbed all my stuff and came here,\" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: \"I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed. I have to make sure I have them with me.\"",

        "full_content": "There is some bad news for folks who like $2 t-shirts and jeans that fall apart after three uses: President Trump is ending the “de minimis” trade exemption that enabled Temu and SHEIN to ship goods to the United States without paying any import duties. President Trump already cancelled the exemption once before, only to reinstate it because U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were overwhelmed by the flood of new packages they would have to inspect. But an executive order signed on Tuesday officially ends the exemption on May 2. Under the new rules, goods that have previously qualified for the exemption will be subject to a duty of either 30% of their value or $25 per item, whichever is higher. On June 1, the duty will increase to $50. Temu and SHEIN will either need to raise prices or send more goods in bulk to be stored in U.S. warehouses, which is something the latter has already been working on, with distribution centers opening in several states. Temu for its part has been adding US-based sellers to its marketplace and steering customers there. Which is to say, the onslaught of garbage, disposable goods containing toxic chemicals and produced on slave labor wages likely will not end with this executive order. Temu and SHEIN can be thought of best as H&M or Forever 21 on steroids. The discount e-commerce websites produce cheap goods, like t-shirts and flip flops, in China and ship them directly to customers, instead of storing them in warehouses in the United States. Promoting through platforms like TikTok, these websites have ballooned in size by quickly identify new fashion trends and enabling teenagers and young adults to try out them out on a limited budget. Besides sidestepping shipping duties, China has also negotiated very low international shipping fees with couriers including the United States Postal Service, which means shipping from China to the United States is often cheaper than shipping domestically, between states. Critics say this has created an unfair playing field for Chinese ultra-budget websites. According to eMarketer, Temu alone will sell $30 billion worth of products in the U.S. in 2025. Companies including Amazon and TikTok are attempting to compete with their own marketplaces for cheap goods. The cancellation of de minimis may not necessarily help them, depending on where the goods originate. President Trump’s new universal tariffs on all imports have been criticized across the political spectrum as a tax on individuals and businesses, and punishing foreign countries based on an incorrect calculus of what they charge the U.S. They are particularly regressive, since lower income consumers have less wiggle room to accommodate higher costs of goods. It is hard to argue that Temu and SHEIN are good services, however. They are selling cheap garbage that does not last. Either you pay $2 for a shirt that has to be replaced after two weeks, or you pay $10 for a shirt that will at least last a few months or longer.   \nAmazonpresident trumpsheinTemu  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          What could go wrong?\n         \n          Bezos' attempt at forming an internet satellite constellation has a lot of catching up to do, but it's finally set to begin.\n         \n          The president said China was \"not happy\" with his tariffs, which are currently decimating the U.S. stock market.\n         \n          Most semiconductor chips used in the United States are imported from Asia.\n         \n          Social media users have noted that there appears to be no logic behind the tariffs.\n         \n          The TikTok ban goes back into effect on April 5.",

        "full_content": "Chloe Veltman\n    \n \n                Prior to the Eaton Fire in January 2025, the Zane Grey Estate was a beloved historical and cultural landmark — the former home of Western novelist Zane Grey.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Pickering Photography/Teresa Fuller, Compass Real Estate\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The former home of one of the world's most famous western novelists, Zane Grey, was a Mediterranean Revival house designed with high, wood-beamed ceilings and airy balconies.  \"It had almost a cathedral vibe when you walked in,\" said Nathaniel Grouille on a recent visit to the site. He bought the property with his wife in 2020. It's been almost two months since the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes in Altadena, including several noted historic and cultural landmarks like this one, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.  During a visit in February, the shattered glass from the estate's windows was still underfoot, along with blackened wood, twisted gutters and broken pieces of ceramic. All that the fire left standing are the sturdy concrete walls.  Gray was known in the 1920s and '30s for his adventure novels set on the American Frontier, like Riders of the Purple Sage and The Lone Star Ranger. Inside, his house reflected his interest in the Old West and Southwest — and those charred concrete walls that remain still bear faint traces of his interests. \"You can see the white stencils made it through the fire, even though the paint itself is gone,\" said Grouille's wife Alice Carr, pointing to a wall painted with Hopi spiritual figures. \n                The Zane Grey Estate in Altadena was almost completely destroyed in the January 2025 Eaton Fire. But unlike other neighboring homes which were largely made of wood, its walls were made of concrete — so they mostly remained intact.\n                \n                    \n                    Chloe Veltman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Grouille and Carr are now facing a big question: How to rebuild the site in a way that preserves Grey's legacy while protecting it from the inevitable future fires and other disasters resulting from the impacts of human-caused climate change? Returning the property to what it was in Zane Grey's day isn't on the couple's agenda. \"This structure was incredibly unique, using really high quality old-growth wood and products that just don't exist today,\" Carr said.  Grouille said they have no interest in using modern materials to build a Zane Grey Estate lookalike — \"A sort of Las Vegas version of a historic house.\" Instead, they'd rather reframe the author's legacy to make sense in an era where human-caused climate change creates increasing threats — perhaps by building new, resilient structures out of sustainable materials that architecturally nod to Grey's personality and passion for the West. \"He mixed sort of a Teddy Roosevelt-type pragmatism with a great romance,\" Grouille said. \"That's the kind of the thing you want to preserve.\" Conservation experts are familiar with this tension.  \"That can sometimes be a delicate balance,\" said Seri Worden, Senior director of preservation programs with the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  Worden said adding a metal roof or removing flammable plantings may increase a historic landmark's chances of surviving a wildfire. But these interventions, if not done carefully, can ruin what makes these places special. \"How can we ensure that we can adapt the historic materials without losing the power these places have?\" Worden said. \n                The Gamble House in Pasadena, a National Historic Landmark, was in a fire evacuation zone in the Los Angeles Fires. Its custodians are now making complex decisions about how to safeguard its future against the impacts of human-caused climate change while at the same time maintaining the historic details and atmosphere for which it is admired.\n                \n                    \n                    Chloe Veltman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n This is a question that historic sites that escaped the flames from the recent fires are also asking themselves — such as The Gamble House. The 1908 property, owned by the City of Pasadena and a National Historic Landmark since 1977, is a crowning example of American Arts and Crafts design — a sprawl of redwood shingles and copper pipes.  It was under an evacuation warning during the recent fires; the team temporarily removed a few key artifacts as a precaution.  \n                The Gamble House is recognized worldwide as a gem of American Arts and Crafts design. Its custodians say if it were to burn down, it would be irreplaceable.\n                \n                    \n                    Alexander Vertikoff/Vertikoff Archives\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n \"We are an enormous wood structure. So fire makes all of us very nervous,\" said Sheryl Scott, the site's director of communications and operations. Scott said The Gamble House staff had previously been focused on earthquake and flood mitigation. Now with the possibility of more fire danger in the future, her team has been making complex decisions.  One was whether to remove the beautiful but potentially hazardous creeping figs clinging to the façade. They decided no. Instead, the plan is to keep the nearby shrubs and trees trimmed.  Another has been figuring out how best to protect the buildings' historic but extremely flammable shingles, also known as shakes. That's a topic of ongoing investigation.  \"We can't replace our shakes with fakes,\" Scott said. \"The integrity of the structure, the historic content, is important to us.\" \n                The Gamble House in Pasadena\n                \n                    \n                    Alexander Verikoff/Vertikoff Archives\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n All of this work takes resources. There are pockets of foundation and donor money. Conservation groups like the Los Angeles Conservancy connect historic landmarks with experts such as architects and contractors willing to provide pro bono or reduced rate assistance.  But Scott said it's a hard time for California landmarks to get grants for protecting or rehabilitating historic sites against disasters. The state's Office of Historic Preservation told NPR it does not offer them. Federal funding sources like the National Park Service are also facing cuts under the Trump Administration. \"Everyone's nervous about the amount of money that's available,\" Scott said. With limited resources, Scott said her team is figuring out what to prioritize in order to keep The Gamble House standing for future generations.  \"The ongoing care and long term survival of the house is always our main priority,\" Scott said. \"Every decision we make is examined through the lens of being responsible stewards.\" Audio and digital story edited by Jennifer Vanasco.

        "full_content": "Less than a month into the second term of Donald Trump, the president signed an executive order that gave the non-governmental Department of Government Efficiency broad powers to gut the federal workforce, in the name of cost-cutting. DOGEâled by the multibillionaire “special government employee” Elon Muskâhas proceeded with zeal, working to scrap funding for veterans’ cancer treatments, reportedly cutting FDA employees directly working on Musk’s company Neuralink, slashing (and then walking back) layoffs in the National Nuclear Security Administration, cutting about 1,000 staff working for the National Park Service across the country, and this month, after a faltering start, beginning layoffs at NASA, the nation’s space agency. During the final week of February, hundreds of federal workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were firedâabout 10% of the agency workforce. One of the affected employees was Andrew Hazelton, a meteorologist who grew up in Florida and until last month spent his days with the Hurricane Research Division Modeling Team, which helps NOAA understand these extreme storms and mitigate the worst of their impacts. Hazelton is now on administrative leaveâhe’s not allowed to workâa temporary reinstatement position that could keep him (and many other NOAA staffers) in limbo as their situation works through the federal court system. Gizmodo spoke with Hazelton by phone this week to discuss the position that he and hundreds of other federal employees at NOAA are dealing with as the DOGE cuts roll through the federal workforce. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity. Isaac Schultz, Gizmodo:Â  I understand things have changed in the last day with a memo temporarily reinstating staff in “paid, non-duty” status, which potentially adds a new dimension to our conversation. Walk me through the timeline here, from your work at NOAA to the layoffs and basically how far along this rollercoaster we are now. Andrew Hazelton:Â  I’ve been with NOAA in varying capacities for over 8 years. After I got my PhD in 2016, I worked with a postdoc at Princeton University for the NOAA lab up there, NOAA GFDL in Princeton for 2 years, and then I went to AOML, the Hurricane Research Division, in 2018, working for the University of Miami. Last October I started the federal position, working for NOAA’s Environmental Modeling Center doing hurricane models and model development. As of yesterday we areâon paper at leastâreinstated with admin leave, because of the court decision over the weekend. What that looks like exactly, though, there’s still a lot of questions that we’ll have to get answers about. It seems as thoughâ based on the wording of what they sent usâthat they’re waiting for another court to say that they can go through with backpay. And right now we’re not allowed to work. I was a new federal employee even though I’ve worked with NOAA for 8 years or more, and then February 27th we all got that mass email basically just informing us that we were being fired. It was sort of chaotic because they had about an hour’s notice.Â We’ve been in this limbo state. I know some people filed appeals with the merit board. There was this preliminary injunction that allows us to be reinstated, but it seems like it’s going to depend on appeals of that. And there’s still some uncertainty as to whether there could be a legal layoff process after that. Gizmodo: It seems like across a number of agencies, folks are not only being hit with these layoffs, but then being stuck in these situations where it’s very unclear exactly what their status is, and what the federal government’s next move is going to be. Hazelton: Right. It’s depending on court outcomes, and even across departments it seems like certain ones are responding to the rulings differentlyâsome more enthusiastically than others. There are a lot of unknowns. Gizmodo: We could speak about some more unknowns, frankly. Your focus is hurricanes. How many folks who work specifically on the hurricanes have been impacted, at least for the time being, and what this might mean for the publicâpeople who need information about incoming storms? Hazelton: In my group, I was the main person doing hurricanes. There were other people doing other kinds of modeling: severe weather and ocean models, all sorts of things. There were other people in NOAA that were part of the hurricane hunters, the ones that fly into the hurricanes, and I did that as part of my last role. There were a few people from that group that were laid off. A couple dozen may have gotten reinstated as part of the judge’s decision, but there wasn’t much communication about what criteria were used for that, but some were not fully reinstated. They’ve not given a lot of information about criteria or plans, but the big thing is that, if people aren’t fully reinstated, it’s going to be hard. These are people working on some of the computer models that are our main tools collecting data. I know people in the satellite division have been affected, and satellites are one of our big tools for monitoring all sorts of weather, not just hurricanes. Effects could be felt across the board, for anybody who relies on weather data. Gizmodo: Just because our readers are very familiar with hurricanesâmany are in the American Southeastâcan you name a couple of the storms that you flew through? Hazelton: Because I was there through last year, it was the first part of the hurricane season. I was in Helene last year, and then I’ve also flown in storms like Michael in 2018, Dorian in 2019, Ian, which most of the Gulf people remember, Idalia. I’ve flown in quite a few big ones and done work with the aircraft data and also the modeling. Gizmodo: What is it like to fly through a hurricane, and what storm was the most unnerving to go through? Hazelton: Most of the flight is just kind of like a bumpy commercial flight. It’s a P-3 aircraft. It’s a propeller planeâkind of a bumpy, noisy plane in generalâbut very sturdy. But when you get in the eyewallâthat ring near the center that’s the most intense part of the hurricaneâthat’s where you can see some real bumps. I think Michael was probably the storm that was the bumpiest. I wasn’t on the famous Ian flight where they got really rocked aroundâI was the one before that. So Michael and also Helene last year was a pretty intense eyewall. We didn’t want to fly through because it was just so gnarly looking on radar. Gizmodo: People in and affiliated with this administration talk a lot about privatizing weatherÂ forecasting. What are your opinions on that, and what might that outlook mean for federal workers and for the way the public gets their weather information, depending on how successful you imagine that that effort being, should they proceed with it? Hazelton: The thing is there’s already a pretty robust private weather enterprise. There are private companies that do good work. We work with them and a lot of them rely on NOAA data for their apps or different tools. It’s really a pretty good public-private partnership that I think is honestly a model for that kind of thing. I don’t think we want to get to a point where there’s like a subscription-based model for warnings or any sort of life-saving data or information. Honestly, open access to data for the cost of your tax dollars is one of the things that’s really been a model of NOAA. If you look at the numbers, it only costs 6 cents per American per day to fund all of NOAA at its current level. It’s a pretty minuscule cost when you look at like the dollars saved. Whenever there’s a hurricane, better forecasts allow people to get outâor vice versa, if they’re not going to be impacted, they don’t have to close up their school or business. Better forecasts save lives and money. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself. Gizmodo: You mentioned that some folks were reinstated early on. It sounds like it’s kind of a black box as to how those decisions are being made. Is that a fair characterization? Hazelton: Yeah, there hasn’t really been a whole lot of criteria or communication. I think there was supposed to be some veterans’ preference for prior federal service, but it really hasn’t been made clear at all to us how these decisions are being made. Gizmodo: In that case, a silly question that I’ll ask anyway: Is there any idea of how long this ambiguity will last? Hazelton: No, not really. I think it’s going to depend a lot on court cases and how those play out. That’s above my pay grade. I’m just ready to get back to work doing what I love doing and what helps protect the American public. Gizmodo: Given the abruptness of these layoffs and your hands being tied with work, it sounds like you just have some stuff sitting on your desk waiting to be resumed, which with something as dynamic as weather, is probably not the best thing. Hazelton: It’s tough. My coworkers, the ones that are still there, they’re great and they’re working hard, but it’s just hard when you have an agency that’s already understaffed and just being stretched even thinner. It’s hard to get everything done that you want and need to. Gizmodo: Is there anything you really want to get across about either your personal experience right now or the experience of federal workers more generally at this time? Hazelton: Most of us just want to get back to the work we’re doing to help the American public. NOAA’s mission is to protect lives and property. We have a track record of doing that and that’s what we want to get back to doing. \nFederal GovernmentHurricanelayoffsNOAAWeather  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          More than 1,600 respondents reflected the chilling effect across research fields caused by the slashing of federal funding for universities and science agencies.\n         \n          Weather balloon operations will stop or be reduced at 11 locations across the country due to staffing shortages caused by recent NOAA layoffs.\n         \n          The nation's space agency is cutting costs at the behest of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as part of the Trump administration's slashing of science funding.\n         \n          Hurricane Helene, which slammed into Florida's Big Bend in late September, caused the deaths of nearly 250 peopleâa number only dwarfed by the infamous 2005 storm.\n         \n          The hurricane jumped three Safford-Simpson hurricane categories in less than a day, and scientists now propose a new factor that contributed to the storm's evolution.\n         \n          Managers have hit walls trying to rehire former employees due to mysterious and unexplained blocks on their profiles.",

A magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar caused widespread shaking and likely considerable damage because of a lack of buildings built to withstand temblors By Robin George Andrews edited by Andrea Thompson A resident carries belongings over debris next to a damaged building in Naypyidaw on March 28, 2025, after an earthquake in central Myanmar. Sai Aung MAIN/AFP via Getty Images On March 28, at around midday local time, tens of millions of people in Southeast Asia felt the earth below their feet violently rupture. A magnitude 7.7 earthquake, centered just 12 miles away from Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the region—causing streets to buckle, ancient pagodas to crumble, bridges to shatter and houses to collapse. Entire neighborhoods were devastated in a matter of seconds. The earthquake’s energy release was comparable to that of several hundred nuclear weapon explosions. “The magnitude of this event was so high that it was felt in neighboring countries,” says Amilcar Carrera-Cevallos, an earthquake scientist at the Vicente Rocafuerte Secular University of Guayaquil in Ecuador. A 30-story skyscraper under construction in Bangkok—600 miles from the quake’s epicenter—disintegrated. According to estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey, there will be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of casualties, as well as tens of billions of dollars of economic damage. Many factors conspired to make this earthquake a disaster, including a lack of quake-proofing measures in buildings across the region. Few of the structures could withstand this monster of a temblor, which was “a really big, shallow earthquake”—meaning it occurred relatively close to the Earth’s surface, says Judith Hubbard, an earthquake scientist at Cornell University.

Around 45 million years ago, the Indian tectonic plate collided with the Eurasian plate before the former started to descend beneath the latter. The crumbled crust in the middle is what we refer to as the Himalayas today. This mountain range, and the entire region, is filled with faults generated by that epic geological pileup. The Indian plate is still very slowly running into Eurasia, and those myriad faults take on a lot of stress as a result. From time to time, they rupture. The March 28 event was an especially gargantuan rupture along one specific schism. “All available data so far strongly suggest a rupture on the Sagaing Fault,” says Robin Lacassin, an earthquake scientist at the Paris Institute of Earth Physics. This is a major north-south “strike-slip” fault, one in which two blocks of the crust slide past each other (a bit like the San Andreas Fault in California). The Sagaing Fault is “the main strike-slip boundary on that side of the Indian plate,” Lacassin says. And it “has been responsible for many strong and destructive earthquakes in the past.” Cars pass a damaged road in Naypyidaw on March 28, 2025, after an earthquake in central Myanmar. Sai Aung Main/AFP via Getty Images Hubbard points out that, just in May 2023, the very same fault ruptured and generated a magnitude 5.8 temblor, causing a modest degree of destruction. It’s a particularly perilous fault, not least because Nay Pyi Taw, the capital city of Myanmar, lies directly atop it. Today’s magnitude 7.7 rupture was exponentially more powerful than the 2023 event. Earthquakes are measured on the modified Mercalli intensity scale, which gauges the shaking intensity based on surface observations. Close to the epicenter, nearly a million people felt this quake as IX, or “violent,” on the scale: many buildings weren’t just damaged but also thrown about, with some literally shifted off their foundation. Slightly farther from the epicenter, the shaking ranked as “severe” or “very strong”—and onlookers in Thailand were shocked to see buildings there receive damage as well. Preliminary data suggest that seismic waves traveled so far from the source because they were channeled along the southern section of the Sagaing Fault. “This would explain the damage in Bangkok and reports that it was felt far away,” Carrera-Cevallos says. Earthquakes like this are a horrific reminder of why disasters cannot purely be referred to as “natural.” Today’s quake was powerful, yes—but the cities in the blast zone didn’t stand a chance because of a decidedly human factor. “This earthquake occurred in an area with no earthquake-resistant buildings and inadequate building codes,” Carrera-Cevallos says. Although you cannot design a building to guarantee that it will hold up against the mightiest of earthquakes, you can fit dampeners into their architecture to allow them to safely “sway” in the event of a temblor. Even older structures can be retrofitted to include various forms of quake-resistant technology. The damage in Thailand is shocking but is unlikely to be too severe. The shaking there was less intense than in Myanmar, and the high-rise skyscraper that collapsed in Thailand was under construction, so it is probably an outlier. “We can expect much worse in Myanmar,” Hubbard says. Myanmar’s political situation will work against its recovery efforts. A military coup in 2021 and an ongoing civil war had already displaced millions of people from their homes. This quake is going to dramatically inflate that number, exacerbating an already extensive humanitarian crisis. Strong aftershocks will shake cities, towns and villages for several weeks to come, also impeding the likely chaotic recovery efforts.",

        "full_content": "Metrics A puzzling tsunami entered Japanese history in January 1700. Samurai, merchants, and villagers wrote of minor flooding and damage. Some noted that no parent earthquake had been felt; they were wondering what had set off the waves. They had no way knowing that the tsunami had been spawned during an earthquake along the coast of northwestern North America. This orphan tsunami would not be linked to its parent earthquake until the middle 1990s, through an extraordinary series of discoveries in both North America and Japan. The Orphan Tsunami of 1700, now in its second edition, tells this scientific detective story through its North American and Japanese clues. The discoveries underpin many of today’s precautions against earthquakes and tsunamis in the Cascadia region of northwestern North America. The Japanese tsunami of March 2011 called attention to those hazards as a mirror image of the transpacific waves of January 1700.

        "full_content": "The Japanese government is releasing rice from its emergency reserve for the first time to address a supermarket shortage and soaring prices. Japan's agriculture ministry held an auction last week in a bid to stabilize the market. It announced on Friday it had selected bidders for almost 142,000 tons of rice from the government reserve, local media reported. Bidders are paying 21,217 yen (about $143) per 60 kilograms and the extra supplies are expected to start reaching stores later this month. Releasing such a large amount of rice would improve the \"supply-demand balance,\" agriculture minister Taku Eto told a press conference.  He said the ministry would carry out another auction later this month.  Rice supplies in Japan started to decline last summer, sending prices sharply higher. Experts have blamed the problem on high temperatures in 2023 damaging crops, and stockpiling over fears of an earthquake — and expectations that prices would keep rising. Despite the intervention, the agriculture ministry said a 5-kilogram bag of rice cost an average of 4,077 yen (about $27) at some 1,000 stores in the week ending March 9. That's almost double the price this time last year and marks the 10th consecutive weekly increase.  Core consumer price index data released by Japan's internal affairs ministry at the end of January showed that the price of rice rose nearly 71% year-on-year in Tokyo's 23 wards. The 231,000 tons of rice authorized to be released from the stockpile represents about 20% of the total, The New York Times reported.",

        "full_content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Twenty years into the smartphone era, you can depend on seeing a natural disaster on video a few seconds after it occurs. If a rainstorm floods a subway tunnel or a fire consumes a residential neighborhood, a real-time documentary is not far behind. On Friday at midday local time, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar. Thousands are feared dead. Even in one of the poorest countries in the world, footage of the event itself was immediately available: monks cowering as a building collapsed down the block, a stupa tipping off a temple building in a shower of red dirt. Hundreds of miles away in Bangkok, a construction worker filmed his colleagues running from a half-finished skyscraper as it collapsed into a cloud of dust. I’m mesmerized by a relatively new entrant into this genre: The sight of rooftop pools sloshing over their parapets, raining water onto the streets below. A handful of skyscrapers in Bangkok spilled over on Friday. Like a lamp swinging from the ceiling, these high-rise waterfalls are a testament to the seismically generated building movement that can be hard to see with the naked eye. Water suddenly appears in places there is not supposed to be water. It’s like seeing a building cry. If you really want a lesson in fluid dynamics, you can watch the videos of the pools themselves. It’s unsettling to see a tall building spill its drink like a drunk at a party. But ultimately, it’s proof of structural achievement: The buildings rock enough to send hundreds of gallons of water overboard, but in spite of their height, they are strong enough to resist the tremors. (It is the age of a building, not its height, that generally puts occupants at risk during an earthquake.) While this phenomenon is not brand new—quake-driven rooftop pool waterfalls have been caught on camera in Manila, Puerto Vallarta, and Taipei in recent years—it’s increasingly frequent. And not just because more people are pointing their phones at the sky. Putting a pool at the top of a building is a relatively recent development in the history of high-rise construction. Water is heavy (don’t fill up an inflatable pool on your roof), and when pools aren’t well-built, the damage can be enormous. There’s a reason landlords don’t want tenants to have fish tanks. According to a report on high-rise pools from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Chicago’s John Hancock Center was the first super-tall building to offer a swim with a view when its 44th-floor pool opened in 1969. But as recently as 2000, most of the world’s super-tall buildings (over 900 feet) did not include pools. That has changed: Since the millennium, most of them do. Some of that reflects the engineering innovations that have allowed giant buildings to proliferate in recent decades. But it’s also a testament to the changing geography of global growth, as skyscraper construction has shifted from North America and Europe to the Gulf and East Asia. Two-thirds of the world’s super-tall buildings have been built in China and the UAE alone, and rooftop pools are obviously a more desirable amenity in warm-weather locales. In Southeast Asia, the skyscrapers with rooftop pools—often flanked by cocktail bars, dance floors, or expensive restaurants—are a societal status symbol. The most famous visual landmark associated with Singapore is probably the Marina Bay Sands, with Moshe Safdie’s oblong, swimmable rooftop straddling three buildings. Most rooftop pools aren’t so easy to spot from below. And that’s part of what makes the videos from Bangkok so revelatory. Disasters pretend to be egalitarian. Ultimately, though, they expose the fissures in society, revealing the disparate experiences between those who have a well-built home, an insurance policy, or somewhere else to go—and those who do not. When water tumbles from a roof, it reveals the power of the earthquake, but also the hidden inequality of the city, provoking the sudden realization, from a lower floor or a hot street below, that those people up there can go for a swim. Meanwhile, in Myanmar, first responders are trying to find people trapped in the wreckage of collapsed structures. The grim reason it takes a long time to confirm an earthquake’s death toll is that many people, if not most, survive the initial collapse. What determines their fate is how quickly someone comes to look for them.",

        "full_content": "A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday afternoon local time near the country’s second-largest city, Mandalay. The quake caused extensive damage across Myanmar and also toppled a skyscraper under construction in Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles away. After the quake, the Myanmar military junta declared a state of emergency in six regions and confirmed more than 100 people killed and many hundreds injured, while Thai officials reported at least seven deaths and scores of people missing. A report from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the death toll will likely exceed 1,000, and could even surpass 10,000 given the quake’s epicenter near populated areas. Myanmar sits atop one of the most tectonically active regions in the world, along a 9,300-mile swathe of land called the Alpide Belt, which extends across the southern region of Eurasia, from the Mediterranean, eastward through Asia, and into the East Indies. The Alpide belt is one of three major earthquake zones on Earth, and is responsible for about 15 percent of all the world’s largest earthquakes, second only to the Ring of Fire in the Pacific. The belt’s tectonic activity has birthed many of the world’s most impressive mountain ranges, including the Alps, the Atlas Mountains, and the Himalayas. Today’s quake today is similar in size and magnitude to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Zhigang Peng, a seismologist at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who has studied quakes along the Alpide in Turkey, says that while Myanmar has experienced large earthquakes in the past, today’s quake—followed by a magnitude 6.7 aftershock roughly 11 minutes later—is among the most powerful to hit the region in recent memory. Since 1900, at least six quakes measuring a magnitude of at least 7 have been recorded within 150 miles of Friday’s quake, according to USGS. We spoke with Peng about the region’s seismic history, the causes of today’s quake, and what scientists know about what might be coming. Myanmar is one of the most seismically active areas in the world. Can you tell me about the history of earthquakes in this region? Myanmar is near the southeastern end of the Alpide Belt, and long story short, this area is a well-recognized section of the belt where earthquakes are pretty common. Most of the belt is seismically active, or was in the past. For example, the Alps are part of the system, but most of that area is not tectonically active right now even though it was in the distant past. [Recent research suggests that parts of the southern Alps may still be active.] Of course, earthquakes of such a size as this one are rare, but they have happened. If I remember correctly, the last time a similar-sized event occurred in this region was in 1839, and it was a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. But there have been many “smaller” quakes in the area, including a magnitude 6.8 in 2011. What is driving all this tectonic activity? Is it the same as what is happening in other earthquake-prone places like the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean, the most seismically and volcanically active region in the world? The area has a lot of different things going on. A big part of what is happening is that the African, Arabian, and Indian tectonic plates are moving northward and colliding with the Eurasian tectonic plate. More locally, in Myanmar, the Indian plate is colliding with the Sunda plate, which straddles the equator in the Eastern hemisphere. That’s a subduction zone, where one plate is going underneath another one. But near the edge of this boundary you get what we call a transform or strike-slip fault—one block is moving north, another block is moving south. It’s similar to the San Andreas Fault in the U.S., and actually, this quake today is somewhat similar in size and magnitude to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The Ring of Fire in the Pacific is also a subduction zone, but it’s different in the sense that it’s a lot more volcanically active, and a lot of the earthquakes there are linked to the volcanism in the region. This is a classic example of an earthquake occurring at a place where we know it’s going to happen. How would you describe this particular earthquake? Today’s event is actually very simple. This earthquake was not a part of the mountain-building process, but occurred along a strike-slip fault in Myanmar called the Sagaing Fault. From what I’ve seen, the event is a pretty typical continental strike-slip event. It looks like a fault section of about 200 kilometers broke in a single event near Mandalay, and it mostly propagated to the south. It was pretty shallow, probably around 10 kilometers or so deep, and because the event is so large, it took about one minute to unfold itself and produced some pretty significant shakes. I’ve seen a lot of infrastructure damage, buildings and bridges coming down. [USGS has estimated that the quake ran along a fault section that lies 6 miles (10 kilometers) deep, 124 miles long and 12 miles wide.] Was there any inkling that this particular area was due for an event of this magnitude? Earthquake scientists have studied this region for quite some time, and I would call this a classic example of an earthquake occurring at a place where we know it’s going to happen. Of course, we don’t know when—that’s always the $1 million question—but you can do the math to find out whether or not it’s within an expected range of time, which we call the recurrence interval. If we think of what happened today as a repeat of what happened in 1839, you can see that it has been almost 200 years. And we know that the slip rate—that’s how much stress has been accumulating along the fault—is generally on the order of about 2 centimeters per year. If it’s 2 centimeters per year, and it has been roughly 200 years, you get about 4 meters of accumulated stress. A slip of that size is enough to produce a magnitude 7 event or higher, and that’s what we observed. What are the secondary hazards of such an earthquake? Typically, the three secondary hazards associated with big earthquakes are landslides, fire, and tsunamis. We can rule out tsunamis because it occurred on land, and it also occurred in a region that is relatively flat, so I wouldn’t expect to see major landslides. There are probably going to be small, localized fires that have the potential to get big if they aren’t contained. But most of what I’m looking at are aftershocks. Earthquakes like this one will almost certainly be followed by aftershocks, and some of them could be large. We should expect to see other large events in the next few weeks to months. Most are going to be smaller than today’s earthquake, however, there’s always a chance of a similar size event or, in the worst case scenario, an even larger event.

        "full_content": "The Can Manufacturers Institute highlighted that today there are only three domestic tin mill lines still open in the U.S. With a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel imports taking effect this week, metals-dependent trade groups in the U.S. are calling on the Trump administration for exemptions. Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, said in a statement Wednesday that consumers will feel inflationary impacts from the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  “Recent history has demonstrated that trade protectionist measures have serious impacts for the U.S. economy and domestic food security,\" he said. “Aluminum and steel tariffs place price pressures on American-produced goods by artificially and dramatically increasing the cost of critical production materials, making U.S.-made food less competitive against foreign products.” According to CMI, the domestic can industry produces approximately 135 billion food, beverage, aerosol and general line cans each year and employs more than 28,000 people. Since 2018 tariffs, U.S. tin mill steel producers shut down nine tin mill lines. “Today, only three domestic production lines remain open in the United States, meaning American steel producers cannot meet U.S. demand even with the highest tinplate steel costs in the world,” Budway said. “This opens the door for cheaper canned foods to flood the U.S. market from China and other foreign competitors.” According to the Aluminum Association, the U.S. aluminum industry has invested more than $10 billion since 2016, largely in “mid-and-downstream production and recycling.” “This has been driven by growing demand, a competitive tax environment and strong, targeted trade enforcement the president supported in his first term,” CEO Charles Johnson said in a statement Wednesday. “For this growth to continue, the U.S. aluminum industry needs two things — long-term market certainty and a reliable supply of affordable metal, which today comes in large part from Canada.” Johnson described U.S. industry’s longstanding trade relationship with Canada “a good deal for America” and called for a deal with Canada that secures robust supply. Canada supplies about two-thirds of the primary aluminum used in the U.S., according to the Aluminum Association. In 2023, the U.S. imported 7.71 billion pounds of aluminum from Canada. In a February letter to Trump, CMI, along with American canned food producers and packaging companies such as Silgan, Sonoco, Crown and Trivium, called for exemptions.",

        "full_content": "Wildfires forced a mandatory evacuation in one North Carolina county as emergency crews fought separate fires in an area of the state still recovering from Hurricane Helene, while South Carolina's governor declared an emergency in response to a growing wildfire. The North Carolina Department of Public Safety announced a mandatory evacuation starting at 8:20 p.m. Saturday for parts of Polk County in western North Carolina about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte. Advertisement Advertisement “Visibility in area will be reduced and roads/evacuation routes can become blocked; if you do not leave now, you could be trapped, injured, or killed,” the agency said in a social media post. The public safety department said a shelter had been established in Columbus, North Carolina. The North Carolina Forest Service's online wildfire public viewer indicated three active fires in Polk County, with the two largest spanning between 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) to 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Two other fires were active in nearby Burke and Madison counties, with a third wildfire burning in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as part of an effort to stop a blaze in Pickens County called the Table Rock Fire that started the previous day in an area within the Blue Ridge Mountains. “As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,” McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued Friday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission. Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain, the forestry commission said in a social media post. The Pickens County Sheriff's Office posted an update late Saturday saying crews had ceased operations and would resume Sunday morning with ground personnel and machinery and assistance from helicopters and air tankers. The fire was about 110 acres (45 hectares) and the public was asked to avoid state Highway 11. North Carolina's western region already had been hit hard by Hurricane Helene in September. Among the extensive damage, flooding washed away more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) of eastbound lanes on Interstate 40 leading to eastern Tennessee and remained partially closed to traffic until March. The hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles (8,046 kilometers) of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts in North Carolina. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service, meanwhile, has been battling a wildfire that broke out in the Wharton State Forest on Saturday. The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles (7 square kilometers) as of early Sunday morning. Firefighters had contained about half of the blaze according to an 8 a.m. update on the service's Facebook page. Emergency officials said they have evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire but the flames were moving away from them and no structures had been evacuated. The cause of the fire is under investigation.",

        "full_content": "Twenty million trees will be planted and 2,500 hectares (6,178 acres) of new woodland created in the west of England as part of a \"national forest\" drive, the government has announced. The Western Forest will be made up of new and existing woodlands across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, the Cotswolds and the Mendips as well as in urban areas such as Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester. It will be the first of three new national forests promised by the government to help meet a legally-binding target of achieving 16.5% woodland cover in England by 2050. However, with only 10% cover achieved so far, environmental groups have warned much more needs to be done to meet tree-planting targets. The most recent research shows the total area of woodland across the whole of the UK is currently estimated to be 3.28m hectares. That represents 13% of the total land area of the UK but in England just 10% is woodland. Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 hectares of woodland to be planted every year. The latest annual figures show about 21,000 hectares were planted, with the vast majority in Scotland and just 5,500 hectares in England. Andy Egan, head of conservation policy at the Woodland Trust, said there had been \"significant progress\" on tree planting but that there was still \"much more to do\" to meet the UK's targets. He said maintaining government funding was essential. \"Successful tree planting and ongoing management needs long-term grant support,\" he said. \"A tough public spending environment could risk undoing much of the good work.\" Alex Stone, chief executive of the Forest of Avon Trust, which leads the partnership behind the Western Forest project, said there were some areas in the region that currently had only 7% of land covered by trees. \"This is about bringing those areas up so we have trees where we really need them,\" she said. \"What we are aiming to do with the Western Forest is get to 20% of canopy cover by 2050 and, in five priority areas, we are looking at getting above 30%.\" The scheme will particularly target urban areas, including Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester. The government said it would be putting £7.5m of public money into the forest over the next five years. It said the project would not only help the UK's drive to net zero but would also promote economic growth and create jobs in the region. Mary Creagh, minister for nature, said she hoped the Western Forest would also \"make a huge difference\" to water quality, flood resilience and to wildlife as well as bringing nature \"closer to people\" in the region. But she conceded there was much more to do in order to hit England's national tree-planting target. \"I am absolutely confident that we can get to where we need to get to,\" she said. \"Projects like this give me hope and confidence that, with everybody pulling together, working with the public sector and the private sector, we can do it.\" She added that, despite ongoing budget cuts, the next two national forests would be delivered by the end of this parliament, with other sources of funding explored. The Western Forest is the first new national forest to be designated in England in 30 years, following the creation of the original National Forest across Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire, where 9.8m trees have been planted.",

        "full_content": "A pilot has been fined after failing to maintain communication with air traffic control, which led to a flight being intercepted by Britain's Royal Air Force. An investigation by the UK Civil Aviation Authority found that the pilot, Christopher Hollands, didn't appropriately communicate via radio with air traffic control during an SAS Connect flight from Oslo, Norway, to the English city of Manchester in February last year. This is against British law per the Air Navigation Order of 2016. Hollands was sentenced to pay £4,511, or $5,849, on Thursday at Manchester Magistrates' Court. According to the CAA, communication was lost for more than 30 minutes during the flight. This led to air traffic control alerting the RAF over fears that the lack of communication could be a sign of a hijacking. Two Typhoon fighter jets intercepted the Airbus A320 aircraft, which was carrying 58 passengers. When the plane landed in Manchester, it was sent to an isolated part of the airport and boarded by armed police. Glenn Bradley, the head of flight operations at the CAA, said in a statement that incidents of lost communication such as this \"are a matter of great concern both for us as the aviation regulator, and for the Government.\" \"Aviation is one of the safest methods of transportation, and it relies on pilots maintaining radio communication with air traffic control through the standard channels during flight,\" Bradley said. \"We continue to work with pilots, airlines, and the Government to reduce similar incidents, including by prosecuting offenders when appropriate to maintain confidence in UK aviation's safety and security.\" Hollands is the first pilot to ever be prosecuted under this law in the UK. The CAA is now warning other pilots that if an incident of lost communication is deemed serious enough, they could face up to two years imprisonment.",

        "full_content": "At a Congressional hearing earlier this week, Matt Blaze made the point that CALEA, the 1994 law that forces telecoms to make phone calls wiretappable, is outdated in today’s threat environment and should be rethought: In other words, while the legally-mandated CALEA capability requirements have changed little over the last three decades, the infrastructure that must implement and protect it has changed radically. This has greatly expanded the “attack surface” that must be defended to prevent unauthorized wiretaps, especially at scale. The job of the illegal eavesdropper has gotten significantly easier, with many more options and opportunities for them to exploit. Compromising our telecommunications infrastructure is now little different from performing any other kind of computer intrusion or data breach, a well-known and endemic cybersecurity problem. To put it bluntly, something like Salt Typhoon was inevitable, and will likely happen again unless significant changes are made. This is the access that the Chinese threat actor Salt Typhoon used to spy on Americans: The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that a Chinese government hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon broke into three of the largest U.S. internet providers, including AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), and Verizon, to access systems they use for facilitating customer data to law enforcement and governments. The hacks reportedly may have resulted in the “vast collection of internet traffic”; from the telecom and internet giants. CNN and The Washington Post also confirmed the intrusions and that the U.S. government’s investigation is in its early stages. \nTags: CALEA, cybersecurity, eavesdropping, national security policy, telecom  \nPosted on April 8, 2025 at 7:08 AM\t\t\t•\n\t\t\t7 Comments",

        "full_content": "Nintendo’s first post-Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Treehouse livestream is being flooded with angry comments from users calling on the company to \"DROP THE PRICE.\"  A cursory glance at the YouTube chat for the stream shows a flood of complaints about the pricing of Nintendo’s move to the next-generation, which includes the $449.99 Switch 2 and, perhaps most controversially, the jump to $79.99 for Mario Kart World. While the Nintendo Switch 2 system itself will retail for $449.99, a bundle is also available with Mario Kart World included for $499.99, saving $30 on the price of the game. But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $79.99. Some Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also cost $79.99. Nintendo has even come under fire for charging for the Switch 2 tutorial video game experience, Welcome Tour, which fans have said should be a free pack-in. Astro's Playroom, for example, comes pre-installed on every PlayStation 5 console, serving additionally as a free tech demo for the DualSense controller. The shock at Nintendo’s pricing is now spilling over into the Treehouse livestream, although the presenters have so far, perhaps understandably, ignored the chat. It seems likely that Nintendo will face this sort of thing from the video game community from now on, piling the pressure on the company to address the complaints.
